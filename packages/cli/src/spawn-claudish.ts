/**
 * Which `claudish` binary a spawned CHILD is.
 *
 * `team` and channel `create_session` spawn children as `spawn("claudish", …)` —
 * by NAME, resolved through PATH. In production that is exactly right: the child
 * should be the installed claudish. In a TEST it is a bug, and a particularly
 * dishonest one, because the suite goes green or red against whatever version
 * happens to be installed on the machine rather than against the tree under test.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical. `mcp-e2e/runner.ts` documents an incident where a code
 * path DELETED from this tree came back to life during a run: installed 7.34.0
 * still contained an `op account get` probe removed here, and it fired on every
 * child spawn while the harness asserted on dev spans from the parent. And the
 * channel e2e's `create_session` test failed for an afternoon against a fix that
 * was already correct in the tree — the child was the installed binary, which
 * still had the bug.
 *
 * `mcp-e2e/runner.ts` solved it locally by writing a `claudish` shim onto PATH.
 * That works, but it makes every harness reinvent the trick, and a harness that
 * FORGETS silently tests the wrong code — the failure mode is a passing or failing
 * test with no indication which binary produced it. This is the same fix promoted
 * to a seam the spawn sites themselves honour, so a harness opts in with one env
 * var and grandchildren inherit it for free.
 *
 * Production behaviour is unchanged: with `CLAUDISH_BIN` unset the result is
 * exactly `spawn("claudish", args)`.
