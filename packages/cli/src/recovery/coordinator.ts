/**
 * The recovery coordinator — one EPISODE per unreachable target, shared by
 * every request that is failing against it.
 *
 * WHY A COORDINATOR AND NOT N INDEPENDENT LADDERS. Claude Code issues
 * concurrent requests: the main loop, the small title/summary model, and every
 * subagent. During an outage all of them fail within milliseconds of each
 * other. Give each its own ladder and you get N times the connect attempts
 * against a dead network, N unsynchronised countdowns, and no single number a
 * banner could ever show. With one episode there is one timer per target, every
 * parked request wakes together, and each still re-issues ITS OWN bytes —
 * which matters, because they are different requests and the body was
 * serialized per request.
 *
 * THREE LIFETIMES LIVE HERE AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME OBJECT. This is the
 * distinction the design got wrong once and it is worth restating:
 *
 *   - the DEADLINE belongs to one inbound request. Its owner is the waiter.
 *     A waiter past its own deadline answers for itself and leaves.
 *   - the LADDER belongs to the episode. It ends when the last waiter leaves
 *     or an attempt succeeds — never because one waiter ran out of time.
 *   - the PANE LEASE belongs to a renderer painting this episode. It is granted
 *     and revoked in `magmux-ui.ts`, which registers itself here; this file
 *     only ever ASKS, via `uiLeaseValid`, and never caches the answer.
 *
 * Letting one field mean all three is what made a four-waiter episode show
 * `waiters: 4` while exactly one of them was still being retried.

 * That leaves the pane painting *"waiting for Claude Code to retry"* over a
 * session that is already working — for up to two minutes, on the one surface
 * whose legibility is what earns the 503 its retryable status in the first
 * place. A banner that lies is worse than no banner, because the next real
 * outage is read as more of the same.
 *
 * ── WHY THE HEALTHY PATH CAN AFFORD TO ASK ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The caller guards this with `episodeCount() > 0`, which is one `Map.size`
 * read. On a machine that has never had an outage the map is empty and nothing
 * below runs — no URL parse, no string build. That is the whole cost NFR-1
 * pays for the banner telling the truth.
 *
 * ONLY `handoff` is closed, and the restriction is load-bearing: an episode in
 * `attempting`/`waiting` still has parked waiters whose ladder this is, and
 * closing it underneath them would strand or gave-up requests that another
 * request's success says nothing about. A `handoff` episode has no waiters by
 * construction — that is what `handoff` means.
