 * `claude-runner.ts`'s wrap ternary and at its ambient branch, and the
 * consequence was measured on a real launch: `--no-recovery` left the session
 * wrapped in `magmux --id claudish-<pid>`.
 *
 * What that cost a user who had explicitly switched the feature OFF:
 *
 *   - magmux's scrollback ring REPLACES the emulator's own, which
 *     `network-recovery.md` calls the single most user-visible cost of
 *     wrapping by default (RISK-4);

 *   - a generated launcher script on disk, and a login shell between claudish
 *     and Claude Code (RISK-5's whole surface).
 *
 * And it bought NOTHING, by construction rather than by luck: with the ladder
 * disabled `shouldSkipTier1` returns `recovery-disabled` on the first
 * classified failure, so no episode is ever opened, so `ensureRecoveryUi` is
 * never called and the pane can never appear. A wrap whose only consumer can
 * never run is pure cost.
 *
 * It also made RISK-7's mitigation false in the permissive direction —
 * `--no-recovery` is documented as restoring pre-recovery behaviour "byte for
 * byte", which was true of the RESPONSE and false of the LAUNCH.
 *
 * `retryWatchdogEnv` asked both switches from the start; these two sites did
 * not. One predicate now, read by all three, so they cannot drift again.

// ─── The client's retry budget ───────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * The environment that decides how far recovery REACHES, handed to the Claude
 * Code child.
 *
 * Tier 1 holds one inbound request for the derived deadline (~270 s at the
 * default) and then answers a retryable 503, which the client re-POSTs into the
 * SAME episode. So the outer bound on recovery is not ours at all — it is
 * Claude Code's willingness to keep asking, and `CLAUDE_CODE_RETRY_WATCHDOG`
 * is the variable that sets it.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT COSTS, STATED PLAINLY ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * |                            | unset    | set (what ships) |
 * |----------------------------|----------|------------------|
 * | client retry budget        | ~11      | **~300**         |
 * | unattended reach           | ~66 min  | **~a day**       |
 * | worst-case attempts / turn | ~46      | **~2,100**       |
 * | duplicate-charge exposure  | accepted | **~30× that**    |
 *
 * The duplicate-charge exposure is real and is the reason this is worth a
 * paragraph rather than a line: a request the provider ACCEPTED and began
 * billing can still fail on `ECONNRESET`/`EPIPE`, and every re-ask pays for it
 * again — including on paths where inference had already started. That
 * arithmetic was put to the user with these numbers in front of them and the
 * larger magnitude was chosen deliberately. It is an informed acceptance, not
 * an oversight; do not quietly re-litigate it here.
 *
 * ── THE SIDE EFFECT, WHICH IS NOT OPTIONAL ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The watchdog is GLOBAL to the child, so it amplifies every 503 claudish can
 * emit and not only the recovery one: the stream-head sniffer's exhaustion and
 * `exhaustedChainStatus`'s all-transient chain also become ~300-attempt
 * retries. Neither of those opens an episode or a pane, so while the client
 * loops on them the reason is legible NOWHERE — they degrade to "API error ·
 * Retrying" for far longer than before. More retry is the intended remedy for
 * both (an upstream overload is genuinely transient, which is why they are
 * 503s at all), but the visibility argument that earns the recovery 503 its
 * retryable status does not extend to them. That gap is the honest price of
 * one process-wide switch, and there is no narrower lever: the variable is
 * fixed at spawn and cannot key on whether a banner exists.
 *
 * ── THE THREE GATES, AND WHY IT IS NOT JUST THE UI SWITCH ───────────────────
 *
 * All three must hold, because the cost above is only worth paying by a launch
 * that gets the benefit:
 *
 *   1. `resolveRecoveryEnabled()` — the ladder itself. `--no-recovery` /
 *      `CLAUDISH_RECOVERY=0` restores pre-recovery behaviour "byte for byte"
 *      (RISK-7), and an exhaustion that answers today's immediate 400 hands
 *      nothing back for the client to re-ask. A CI run that explicitly opted
 *      out must not be left looping ~300 times on an unrelated 503.
 *   2. `resolveRecoveryUi()` — the user's configuration, flag > env > project >
 *      global > true. Off means no pane, therefore no lease, therefore an
 *      inline 400 at exhaustion. Surface and reach move together or not at all.
 *   3. `paneEligible` — whether THIS LAUNCH can obtain a surface at all, from
 *      `magmuxPaneCapability()`. It is a launch-order fact, not a preference:
 *      false in `-p`, in `--stdin`, with no TTY, and on a machine without
 *      magmux. None of those can ever hold the lease a recovery 503 requires,
 *      so for them the watchdog is the RISK-6 exposure with none of the
 *      recovery benefit, applied to every unrelated 503 the session sees.
 *
 * Gate 3 is why the caller must ask about eligibility BEFORE finalising the
 * child environment — see `magmuxPaneCapability`, which is side-effect free for
 * exactly that reason.
