/**
 * picker/fixtures/fixture-source.ts — a scriptable `PickerDataSource`, for the states
 * a live provider cannot be made to produce.
 *
 * DEV-ONLY. It is reached exclusively through a dynamic `await import()` behind the
 * `CLAUDISH_PICKER_FIXTURE` check in `model-picker-run.tsx`, so `bun build --compile`
 * never walks into this directory and the shipped binary carries no fixture data.
 *
 * IT WRAPS THE PRODUCTION SOURCE AND OVERRIDES ONLY THE SHAPE OF AN ANSWER — never
 * the data. The roster is still derived from the provider definitions, every model row
 * is still the real catalog's, every price and context window is still whatever the
 * backend says. What a scenario forges is the OUTCOME VARIANT (an empty roster, a
 * timeout, a roster where nothing is chat-capable), the readiness answers, and
 * latency. That keeps the "never hardcode rosters, context windows or pricing" rule
 * intact inside a capture harness, which matters because a screenshot of invented
 * prices proves nothing about the layout of real ones.
 *
 * WHY A FAKE AT ALL — the four states below are the whole point of the feature and
 * none of them is reachable from outside:
 *
 *   · `loading`  the credential sweep held mid-`done/total` — the landing screen's
 *                only in-flight state, and on a real machine it is over in a second.
 *   · `discovering` credentials settle normally and the ROSTER never comes back.
 *                This is the per-provider wait, which exists only because a roster
 *                is now fetched when the user OPENS that provider.
 *   · `empty`    a provider that answers correctly with nothing chat-capable.
 *   · `filtered` a provider that serves only embeddings or wildcard routes.
 *   · `timeout`  an unreachable endpoint, on demand.
 *
 * V5 (unauthorized) is deliberately NOT the primary use: it is reproducible live with
 * a bogus key against the real endpoint, which is how the "before" frame was measured,
 * and a live capture beats a forged one every time. The scenario exists as a control.
