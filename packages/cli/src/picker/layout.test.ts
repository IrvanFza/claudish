/**
 * The dialog's two budgets — columns in a row, rows in a box — asserted so they can
 * FAIL ON THEIR OWN DEFECT.
 *
 * An earlier formulation of the column test checked only that a row's cells did not
 * EXCEED the budget. That would have passed the very configuration a colour
 * screenshot fails: a row that sums 39 columns short of its width leaves a dead tail
 * the panel paints as background. A test that cannot fail on the defect it guards is
 * not a guard, so the claim is that the cells sum EXACTLY.
 *
 * The row budget is the one that inline mode makes load-bearing. The dialog reserves
 * rows by scrolling the user's terminal, so a populated dialog and a
 * discovery-failure dialog that were different heights would rewrite rows already
 * handed back to the shell. `deriveDialogLayout` takes the banner's rows out of the
 * LIST's rather than adding them to the box, and that invariant is asserted here
 * rather than left to a screenshot.
