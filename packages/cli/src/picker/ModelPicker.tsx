/**
 * picker/ModelPicker.tsx — one inline dialog, one list, one cursor.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS A CORRECTION OF. The first build of this picker was a
 * full-screen two-pane dashboard: a provider rail beside a model list, a gradient
 * context meter and a gradient price meter on every row, an aggregate-distribution
 * panel, and a five-tier responsive column ladder to keep all of it on an
 * 80-column terminal. The owner's verdict, verbatim: *"no no no this is super
 * unclear what is happening, that should be dialog style"*. A three-model design
 * panel then voted unanimously that the form, not the engineering, was the defect.
 *
 * THE ROOT CAUSE IS MEASURABLE, WHICH IS WHY IT IS WORTH WRITING DOWN. The house
 * TUI guidance requires that over half of a whole frame be graphics rows. On a
 * screen whose content IS a list, a row counts as a graphics row only if it
 * carries a bar — so the gate did not permit a meter on every row, it REQUIRED
 * one. The result, measured on the rejected capture: of 32 visible rows 19 read
 * `1M`, and their meters were indistinguishable. The loudest element on the screen
 * carried the least information, and the aggregate panel above it was added (by
 * its own file header) pre-emptively to top up the same count. The gate is for
 * persistent monitoring surfaces. A picker is a one-shot question.
 *
 * THREE STRUCTURAL DECISIONS FOLLOW, and each one deletes a class of defect:
 *
 * 1. **Inline** (`screenMode: "main-screen"`). The shell prompt and the claudish
 *    banner stay on screen above the dialog. It reads as a program ASKING
 *    something rather than as a program that has taken the terminal, and the
 *    guidance's own `screenMode` table assigns inline to a one-shot command.
 * 2. **One list at a time, one cursor in it.** Two panes meant two cursors with
 *    only a border colour to say which one the arrow keys drove — the literal
 *    cause of "unclear what is happening".
 * 3. **No per-row graphics.** Plain aligned columns; colour reserved for meaning,
 *    one meaning each (`rows.tsx` lists them). The one meter left in the picker is
 *    the credential sweep's `done/total`, which is real progress over countable
 *    work.
 *
 * THE DEFAULT SCREEN IS THE PROVIDER LIST, AND NOTHING IS FETCHED BEFORE IT. An
 * intermediate build landed on a flat 574-row cross-provider list and warmed the
 * cloud catalog AND every credentialled provider's live roster to fill it — a
 * `cloud catalog fetching… / live rosters 0/11 providers` screen the user had to
 * watch before he could do anything. The owner's three corrections, verbatim:
 * *"why we prefetching? we should not, as we show on demand"*, *"we should not
 * show the full list of models, we should show a list of providers by default and
 * only when we go inside we load and resolve all models"*, and *"we should not
 * show unsetted providers, just active"*. So:
 *
 *   · Startup does ONE thing: probe credentials, streaming each answer into the
 *     provider list as it settles. No catalog, no roster, no description index.
 *   · `⏎` on a provider fetches THAT provider's roster and shows it. The failure
 *     UX improves for free — a red panel now answers a request the user made.
 *   · `a` opens the cross-provider list, built from the ONE cached catalog fetch,
 *     enriched by whatever rosters he has already opened and by nothing else.
 *
 * NO AWAIT IS EVER SILENT, STRUCTURALLY RATHER THAN BY DILIGENCE. The roster is
 * derived synchronously, so the first frame is complete before any effect runs;
 * every loader is an effect; and every in-flight task draws an affordance whose
 * SHAPE is chosen by what the caller can actually measure. Nothing invents a
 * denominator.
 *
 * CANCELLATION RETURNS A VALUE. Esc and Ctrl+C both call `onDone(null)`; nothing
 * here calls `process.exit`. The bootstrap's `finally` unmounts React and destroys
 * the renderer in that order, which is what restores the terminal with a fetch
 * still in flight.
 *
 * NO BRANDING IS DRAWN HERE. `printLogo` already wrote the wordmark, `Claude Code.
 * Any Model.` and the version to the scrollback before this renderer opened, and
 * inline mode keeps them on screen — so a second miniature wordmark inside the
 * dialog would be claudish reinventing a logo it already has. The dialog's title
 * bar is a panel title, not a mark.

/**
 * WHICH AFFORDANCE EACH IN-FLIGHT TASK EARNS — the honesty contract, as one pure
 * function so it can be asserted without a renderer.
 *
 * The credential sweep is the only task with a real denominator: the roster is
 * derived synchronously, so `done/total` is work done over work TOTAL. The GET half
 * of discovery has a published DEADLINE and gets an elapsed-vs-deadline bar whose
 * label says `deadline`, because a deadline is not progress. Everything else gets an
 * elapsed figure and a shimmer, which claims only that time is passing.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO `resolving prices` task. `servedModels` resolves pricing
 * from the same local index the rows came from, so there is no second phase — and
 * drawing a label for a phase that never runs is the same lie as an invented
 * denominator.
 *
 * AND THERE IS NO `live rosters` TASK ANY MORE. It had the most defensible meter in
 * the file — a real `done/total` over the providers about to be asked — and it was
 * still wrong, because the work it measured was work nobody had asked for. A
 * truthful bar for an unwanted fan-out is a truthful answer to the wrong question.
