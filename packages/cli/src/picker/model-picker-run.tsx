/**
 * picker/model-picker-run.tsx — bootstrap, teardown, and the ONE stderr write.
 *
 * This is the only place `@opentui/core` and `@opentui/react` meet, and it is reached
 * from `model-selector.ts` through a DYNAMIC `await import()` — which is what keeps a
 * renderer out of the cold-start graph and, more importantly, out of the MCP stdio
 * path, whose stdout is a protocol. `providers/model-ordering.ts:10-18` records why
 * that constraint exists; it applies with more force to OpenTUI than to inquirer.
 *
 * THREE DEPARTURES FROM THE SKILL'S STOCK BOOTSTRAP, each forced by a fact:
 *
 * 1. `screenMode: "main-screen"` — INLINE, and never `useAlternateScreen`. Two
 *    separate facts are packed into that one line.
 *
 *    The KEY: `@opentui/core@0.1.107` renamed `useAlternateScreen` to `screenMode`,
 *    and the old key is an unknown key — silently ignored, no warning, no type
 *    error.
 *
 *    The VALUE: the picker is a one-shot command, which is the row the guidance's
 *    own `screenMode` table assigns to `main-screen`. The first build chose the
 *    alternate screen and was rejected. Inline is not cosmetic here — it is what
 *    makes the dialog read as a program ASKING something rather than a program that
 *    has taken the terminal, it keeps the shell prompt and the claudish banner
 *    (`printLogo`, already written above) on screen so the dialog needs no branding
 *    of its own, and it means the failure notice is still in the scrollback after
 *    the picker closes instead of being discarded with the alternate buffer.
 *
 * 2. `installShutdown` is not used. Its contract ends in `process.exit(code)`, which is
 *    right for an app whose quit key means quit and wrong for a picker, whose entire job
 *    is to hand a model spec back to a caller that then launches Claude Code. What it
 *    guarantees — never leave the terminal wedged in raw mode inside the alternate
 *    screen — is provided by the `finally` below, which always unmounts React and then
 *    destroys the renderer, in that order. Same reasoning, same order, as
 *    `resume-picker-run.tsx:20-29`.
 *
 * 3. `setStderrQuiet(true)` before the renderer and `false` after. Anything written to
 *    the terminal behind a live renderer leaves cells OpenTUI cannot invalidate — ghost
 *    characters, not an exception, which is why no test catches it.
 *
 * AND ONE WRITE THAT IS DELIBERATE, WHICH INLINE MODE MAKES SMALLER BUT NOT
 * UNNECESSARY. Inline rendering leaves the last frame in the scrollback, so the
 * in-dialog failure notice survives `destroy()` — that is one of the reasons for
 * choosing it. What it does NOT survive is truncation: the dialog shows five rows of
 * a notice that may carry an upstream JSON body, and a user piping stderr to a file
 * gets nothing from a rendered frame at all. So every failure seen during the session
 * is buffered and written once, after teardown, at the same point
 * `resume-picker-run.tsx:115` restores stderr. Every failure, in order, not just the
 * one the user landed on: today each failed selection prints immediately, so a session
 * that tried two failing providers leaves two diagnostics, and writing one would be a
 * quiet narrowing.
