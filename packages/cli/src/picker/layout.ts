/**
 * picker/layout.ts — every column and row budget the picker dialog spends, in one
 * place.
 *
 * Flexbox owns the BOXES; arithmetic owns the widths of the cells inside a row,
 * because a row is one `<text>` of `<span>`s and a span cannot `flexGrow`. So a
 * full-width row is a column budget, and a budget that lives at its call site
 * drifts between the header and the rows it labels.
 *
 * THE PROVIDER COMES FIRST AND IT IS SPELLED OUT. The column used to print the
 * routing shortcut — `or@`, `oai@`, `cx@` — and the owner's question was exactly
 * *"what is 'or' means"*. A routing shortcut is information only to someone who
 * already knows it; it does not teach, it obscures. So the leftmost cell is the
 * provider's readable display name (`OpenRouter`, `OpenAI Codex`, `Kimi /
 * Moonshot`), the shortcut moves to the `p` dialog where it sits beside the name
 * that explains it, and the exact routable spec stays on the detail line, which
 * prints it in full.
 *
 * THE MODEL ID IS STILL THE ELASTIC CELL, and every other cell is fixed at every
 * width. There is no responsive ladder: the four fixed cells are the four facts a
 * reader chooses on (which provider, how much context, what it costs, and whether
 * the row is verified) and the name takes everything left. One layout at 80
 * columns and at 145.
 *
 * TWO DIFFERENT PROVIDERS MUST NEVER RENDER IDENTICALLY. That collision — two
 * providers both drawn as `opencod…` — is what the previous provider rail was
 * rejected for, and a readable name column can reproduce it (`OpenCode Zen` and
 * `OpenCode Zen Go` share a twelve-character prefix). `providerColumn` therefore
 * derives the width from the names actually on screen and widens until every one
 * of them is distinct; `MIN_PROVIDER_CELLS` is set from the whole 31-provider
 * list, at which no pair collides.
 *
 * THE DIALOG IS CENTRED AND CONTENT-SIZED. It renders in `main-screen` mode, but
 * `CliRendererConfig` at `@opentui/core@0.1.107` carries no `height` key — the
 * renderer is sized to `stdout.rows` whatever the mode — so "inline" never meant a
 * small region: the previous build simply pinned its dialog to the top and left
 * the rest of a 45-row terminal black. It is now centred in a full-height flex
 * root, vertically and horizontally, which is what the owner asked for and what
 * the row budget below is sized against.
 */
