/**
 * usePickerModels — ONE flat cross-provider list, and the per-provider counts the
 * provider dialog prints.
 *
 * THIS HOOK IS THE FIX FOR "SUPER UNCLEAR WHAT IS HAPPENING". The build it
 * replaces asked the user which PROVIDER before it would answer which MODEL, and
 * put a cursor in each of the two lists with only a border colour to say which one
 * the arrow keys drove. One list has one cursor. So the provider stops being a
 * navigation step and becomes a COLUMN — the routing shortcut, which is also the
 * string the user could have typed on argv.
 *
 * IT IS AFFORDABLE BECAUSE `servedModels` IS SYNCHRONOUS. The obvious
 * implementation — `loadModelsForPickerProvider` per provider — was MEASURED at
 * 10 s for 22 concurrent owner-slug queries, every one of which aborted on its
 * shared timeout and returned zero rows. That is not a slow picker; it is the
 * picker saying "this provider has no models", which is the exact complaint this
 * feature exists to remove. `PickerDataSource.servedModels` reads the catalog's
 * local served-by index instead, in about a millisecond, and
 * `model-catalog.ts:servedByVendor` records why that index is the same authority
 * rather than a second one.
 *
 * ONLY CREDENTIALLED PROVIDERS CONTRIBUTE ROWS, and the absence is EXPLAINED
 * rather than silent: the count in the dialog title reads `24/31 providers`, and
 * `p` lists all 31 with the reason each unready one is not there. A row the user
 * cannot launch is worse than a row that is missing — it fails at
 * `validateApiKeysForModels`, after the picker has closed.
 *
 * ONE `servedModels` CALL PER PROVIDER PER OPEN, held in a ref. Readiness arrives
 * as ~31 separate `setState`s (that incremental fill IS the loading affordance),
 * so a memo that re-derived every provider's rows on each of them would read the
 * slim cache ~500 times.
