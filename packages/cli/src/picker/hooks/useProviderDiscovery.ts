/**
 * useProviderDiscovery — one settled outcome per discovery provider, and the elapsed
 * clock the in-flight indicator is drawn from.
 *
 * NO REJECTION BRANCH, BY CONTRACT. `discoverProviderRoster` never rejects — every
 * throw inside it is mapped to `failed{kind:"unreachable"}` — and
 * `buildDiscoveredModelOutcome` inherits that guarantee through `Promise.allSettled`.
 * That contract is what lets this hook be small; it is also pinned by a unit test
 * with a fetcher registered to throw, because a contract is not a type. The `catch`
 * below exists anyway, for the one failure a contract cannot cover: a data source
 * that is not the production one.
 *
 * THE ELAPSED CLOCK IS NOT STATE. `startedAt` is recorded once per request and the
 * view re-renders from `useAnimationFrame`'s 100 ms tick, computing
 * `Date.now() - startedAt` at render time. Storing elapsed milliseconds in state
 * would be a `setState` per tick for a number nothing else reads.
 *
 * EVERY FAILURE IS REPORTED, NOT JUST THE LAST. `onFailure` fires once per provider
 * whose outcome lands `failed`, in the order they occurred, because that is what the
 * behaviour being preserved does: today each failed selection writes its diagnostic
 * to stderr immediately, so a session that tried two failing providers leaves two
 * lines in the scrollback. Writing one after teardown would be a quiet narrowing.

 * requests, a `live rosters 0/11 providers` meter, and the owner's verdict was
 * *"why we prefetching? we should not, as we show on demand"*. Every one of those
 * requests is now made for a provider the user actually opened, by the hook above.
 * This function spends no network at all: it re-reads the outcomes that are
 * already settled, so a provider he visited enriches the all-models view for free
 * and a provider he did not visit is simply not represented there.
 *
 * ONLY `rows`. A failure's `fallbackRows` are the catalog's, which the flat list
 * already holds under the same provider — merging them would double that
 * provider's rows and launder a fallback into a live roster at the same time.
