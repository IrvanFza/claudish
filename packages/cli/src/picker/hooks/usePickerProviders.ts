/**
 * usePickerProviders — the provider roster, and the credential probe that fills it
 * in.
 *
 * `done/total` FROM THIS HOOK IS THE ONE DETERMINATE BAR IN THE PICKER, and it
 * earns the bar because both numbers are real: the roster is derived
 * synchronously from the provider definitions, so `total` is known before the
 * first probe starts, and `done` is work actually completed. Nothing else the
 * picker waits on has a denominator, and nothing else gets a meter.
 *
 * `probeCredentials` is an AsyncIterable rather than one awaited map for the same
 * reason: each of ~31 `credentials.isAvailable` calls may read env, config, an
 * OAuth file, the macOS Keychain and the 1Password SDK, and a single awaited map
 * would hold every answer hostage to the slowest handshake.
 *
 * MEMBERSHIP IN THE STEADY STATE IS IDENTICAL TO TODAY'S. The old picker filtered
 * unready providers out entirely (`getProviderChoices`), which made the first
 * frame wait for every probe. This mounts the UNFILTERED roster: a provider with
 * no credential contributes no MODEL rows (they would fail later at
 * `validateApiKeysForModels`, after the picker has closed) but it keeps its place
 * in the `p` dialog, with the env var it wants — so the absence is EXPLAINED
 * rather than silent, which is the principle the rest of the feature is built on.
 *
 * ONE FAN-OUT PER MOUNT, never per render: `selectModel` hoisted this call for
 * exactly that reason (its comment at `model-selector.ts:660-668`), and the profile
 * wizard's four-times-over probe is the counter-example this must not become.
