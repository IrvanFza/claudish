 * terminal it consumed and did not give back — a very different economy from a

 * already taken. Seven rows of chrome and eleven of list is the whole allowance
 * (`layout.ts`), and keeping the strips together is what makes that total visible
 * to the next reader instead of scattered across four files that each look cheap.
 *
 * THE DIALOG IS THE ONLY BORDER. The rejected build framed two panels and drew a
 * header strip, a load strip, a filter strip, a stats panel and a footer outside

 * explains an ordering the user did not choose and would otherwise wonder about —
 * why `gpt-5.2` sits above `gpt-5`. The PROVIDER list has no such puzzle: its order
 * is the curated `PICKER_ORDER`, which reads as "the obvious ones first" and needs no
 * caption, so it passes `""` and the row is just the prompt until something is typed.

/**
 * Keyboard hints as KEYCAP PILLS — two abutting segments per hint: the key you
 * press, then what it does.
 *
 * A CHIP HERE IS TWO SEGMENTS, NOT ONE BLOCK BESIDE BARE TEXT. The owner, on the
 * shipped build: *"key suggestion, they should be like chips... the key itself
 * brighter colour and label has backdrop but not as bright, create chips"*. So both
 * halves are filled and the KEY half is the brighter one — it is the thing you press
 * — with the label riding a quieter backdrop beside it:
 *
 *     [ esc ][ quit ]      [ ↑↓ ][ move ]      [ a ][ all models ]
 *       ^brighter                 ^quieter
 *
 * THE TWO SEGMENTS MUST ABUT. One space of padding sits INSIDE each fill and there is
 * none BETWEEN them, so the pair reads as one object with two halves; the gap that
 * separates hints from each other is the parent box's `gap={1}`, outside both fills.
 * A space between the backgrounds splits the pill in half and the affordance is gone.
 * This is a sanctioned case of padding inside a fill, for the same reason `ChipCell`
 * centres inside one: the fill IS the object here, not a highlight on a word.
 *
 * ONE `<text>` PER HINT carries both spans — a `<text>` cannot nest in a `<text>`,
 * and a `<span>` outside a `<text>` renders an error page while the process exits 0.
 * This replaced `BadgeSpan`, whose `label + width` contract describes one fill.
 *
 * THE PILL IS QUIET, AND THE TWO EARLIER ANSWERS WERE THE SAME MISTAKE FROM OPPOSITE
 * ENDS. First it was one neutral grey for both themes, which is a chip that is not a
 * chip: `C.chipKeyBg` measures 1.50:1 against a dark page and 2.38:1 against a light
 * one, so on whichever terminal it was not tuned for it melts and the key reads as a
 * faintly tinted word — the owner reported exactly that from a live light-theme run.
 * The fix was one VIVID purple (`#9333ea`) for both themes, which over-corrected:
 * 5.38:1 on a light page made the footer the loudest thing on a screen whose content
 * is a list.
 *
 * BOTH failures were caused by one hex serving two pages. A keycap is an AFFORDANCE —
 * it says a key exists, not that anything is notable — so it takes madbench's
 * near-background idiom (`paramKeyBg` / `paramValBg`: "near-bg", body ink) and it
 * takes it TWICE, once per palette, because "a shade off the page" points up on black
 * and down on white. MEASURED, because a pale fill does NOT survive a dark terminal:
 * `#B8C2D8` is 1.06:1 on true black, worse than the grey already rejected. Dark gets
 * `#474F63` / `#292D36` (2.57:1 and 1.52:1 off the page, 1.69:1 between them); light
 * gets `#B8C2D8` / `#E4E8F2` (1.79:1 and 1.23:1, 1.46:1 between). Every one of those
 * numbers is pinned by `theme-contrast.test.ts`, including a CEILING — the gate that
 * would have caught the purple.
 *
 * THE INKS ARE STATED, never left to `pickInk`, which reads LUMINANCE alone and would
 * flip on a near-background fill. Each palette declares fill and ink together. All
 * four are read at RENDER time — a module-level `const` here ships one palette's
 * whole construction to the other theme.
 *
 * AN UNAVAILABLE ACTION LOSES THE PILL RATHER THAN BEING HIDDEN — dim text, no fill,
 * so "there is a key here but not now" is visibly different from both a live key and
 * an absent one. Every action is one key and every key is here.
