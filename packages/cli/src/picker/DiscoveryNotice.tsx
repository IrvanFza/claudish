/**
 * picker/DiscoveryNotice.tsx — the four non-`rows` outcomes, rendered.
 *
 * THE WORDS ARE NOT THE DEFECT. Measured against a real 401, the old stderr warning
 * survived on screen in full — provider, cause, HTTP status, endpoint, upstream body,
 * the env var to inspect, where to get a key — and the user still read the short
 * fallback list below it as "this provider has no models". What was wrong was its
 * PRESENTATION: plain white body text for the most severe thing on screen, inline
 * rather than pinned, and a JSON body wrapped mid-word. So this file changes no
 * wording it can avoid changing; it supplies severity, a border, a row budget and a
 * truncation point.
 *
 * THREE TIERS, NEVER COLLAPSED TO ok/fail, copied from `TestResult`
 * (`tui/types.ts:79-107`) whose own comment says `unavailable` is "deliberately
 * neutral, not red":
 *
 *   · `failed`                                   → ERROR  (red on `C.bgError`)
 *   · `empty-roster` / `all-filtered` / `collapsed-empty` → NOTICE (`tokens.warn`)
 *   · `rows` / `unsupported`                     → nothing at all
 *
 * `unsupported` rendering nothing is the load-bearing half of that last row: ~25
 * pickable providers declare no `modelDiscovery`, and for them the catalog list IS
 * the normal, correct UI. A panel there would be noise on the majority case, which
 * is how a user learns to ignore the panel.
