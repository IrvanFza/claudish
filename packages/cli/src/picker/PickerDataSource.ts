/**
 * picker/PickerDataSource.ts — the four slow things the picker needs, behind one
 * interface, plus the production implementation that wraps the existing functions
 * verbatim.
 *
 * THIS SEAM EXISTS BECAUSE THE STATES THAT MATTER CANNOT BE PHOTOGRAPHED
 * OTHERWISE. The whole feature is about what the picker shows when discovery
 * FAILS, serves nothing, or is still in flight — and of those, only "unauthorized"
 * is reproducible against a live provider (a bogus key, a real 401). An empty
 * roster, a roster where nothing is chat-capable, a network timeout and the
 * in-flight frames themselves are not reachable from outside, and the warm catalog
 * path settles faster than a screenshot can catch. So the loaders are a parameter,
 * a scriptable fake drives the capture runs, and the production impl is the
 * default.
 *
 * NOT `mock.module()`: mocking shared infrastructure bleeds across Bun's module
 * registry and breaks sibling e2e files (`feedback_no_mock_module_bleed`). An
 * injected interface cannot leak into another test file.
 *
 * EVERY MEMBER'S SYNC/ASYNC SHAPE IS PART OF THE CONTRACT.
 *
 *   · `providerRoster`, `displayName`, `notEnabledLocalProviders`,
 *     `discoveryShape` are SYNCHRONOUS because the first frame must be complete
 *     before any await, and because the in-flight indicator's SHAPE has to be
 *     chosen before the fetch it describes begins.
 *   · `servedModels` is SYNCHRONOUS, and that is the decision that makes one flat
 *     cross-provider list affordable at all. It reads the catalog's local
 *     served-by index; the async `loadModelsForPickerProvider` asks the same
 *     question with a live `?provider=` query per owner slug, and 22 of those
 *     fired together were MEASURED at 10 s returning zero rows. `servedByVendor`
 *     in `providers/model-catalog.ts` records why the index is the same authority
 *     and not a second one.
 *   · `probeCredentials` is an AsyncIterable rather than a `Promise<Map>` so the
 *     `done/total` counter advances as each probe settles; a single awaited map
 *     would hide ~30 probes behind one silent pause, one of which is a
 *     multi-second 1Password handshake.
