/**
 * picker/detail.tsx — the pane under the list that says what Enter will do, what
 * the provider IS, and what the model IS.
 *
 * IT ANSWERS THE QUESTION A PICKER MUST NEVER LEAVE OPEN: what EXACTLY does Enter
 * return? It prints the spec verbatim — `google@gemini-3.8-flash`, the same string
 * `buildExplicitModelSpec` hands the launcher and the same string the user could
 * have typed on argv — so the picker teaches its own CLI instead of hiding behind
 * a private label.
 *
 * THEN TWO THINGS THE LIST CANNOT SAY, BOTH ADDED BECAUSE THE OWNER ASKED FOR THEM
 * BY NAME:
 *
 *   · **What the provider is.** "we need add more details about provider — now it
 *     has no sense, like what is 'or' means". A row now carries the readable name;
 *     this line carries the rest of the answer — how it bills (a flat-rate plan
 *     charges nothing per token, which is the single most decision-relevant fact
 *     about a route) and which credential it authenticates with, named exactly, so
 *     a reader can go and check the variable rather than guess at it. Every field
 *     comes from `ProviderDefinition` through `PickerProviderChoice`; nothing here
 *     is a table.
 *   · **What the model is.** The old inquirer picker printed the catalog's prose
 *     sentence under the highlighted row and the new dialog dropped it, leaving
 *     `spec · capabilities · date` — four facts about a model's shape and none
 *     about its purpose. It is back, wrapped to the dialog and capped at
 *     `DESCRIPTION_ROWS`. The slim catalog carries no description (0 of 704
 *     entries), so it arrives on its own clock from `providers/model-descriptions`
 *     and the rows are rendered blank until it does — never collapsed, or every
 *     row below would jump when it lands.
 *
 * THE WHOLE PANE IS CHROME, AND IT RECEDES BY ITS INK — NEVER BY A FILL. Rule 6 of
 * `aesthetics-and-color.md` is "dim the chrome, saturate the signal": the list rows
 * are the signal — they are what the cursor moves through and what Enter returns —
 * and this pane is the footnote under them. It used to open with a BOLD ACCENT-BLUE
 * spec line, the loudest text on the screen, under a list drawn in body ink, and the
 * owner asked for the detail to be less prominent.
 *
 * A PASS THAT ANSWERED THAT WITH A BACKGROUND FILL WAS REJECTED, and the rule it
 * broke is the first one claudeup's theme states: panels sit on the terminal's own
 * background and are separated by their border, never by an absolute fill that
 * fights the user's theme. Here the separator already exists — `Rule` draws it one
 * row above — so a fill was a second separator that also painted three rows in a
 * colour the terminal never asked for. The owner's words: "all text in description
 * has different background colours. please bring it back... please remove that
 * different background colours."
 *
 * So the recession is entirely in the INK, three weights, brightest first: the spec
 * and the provider name in `debug` (`C.fgMuted` — a full tier under the body ink the
 * rows above use), everything qualifying them in `subtle`, and the catalog sentence
 * in `subtle` too, which is the dimmest tier there is, because it is the only part a
 * reader can skip without losing a fact. The footer keycaps below stay bright: they
 * are affordances, not prose.
 *
 * CAPABILITIES ARE EXCEPTION-ONLY AND THEY LIVE HERE, NOT ON EVERY ROW. The
 * previous build printed `[TRV]` on all 21 rows of a dynamic models catalog where every model had
 * all three — a column with no variance, in the place a reader is scanning names.
 * On the selected row they are worth three words; on forty rows they are noise.
