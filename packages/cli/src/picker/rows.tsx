/**
 * picker/rows.tsx — one model row, one provider row, one column header, and the
 * pure label arithmetic behind them.
 *
 * ALIGNED TEXT AND CHIPS. NO METERS, NO GRADIENTS. The build this replaces drew a
 * context meter and a price meter on every row, and the reason it had to is written
 * down: a whole-frame graphics-density gate counts a list row carrying a bar as a
 * graphics row, so on a screen whose content IS a list there is no way to pass it
 * without decorating every row. The result was measured — of 32 visible rows, 19
 * read `1M`, and their bars were indistinguishable. Two full columns of gradient
 * encoding one repeated value, beside the numerals that already said it. A CHIP IS
 * NOT A METER: it draws no magnitude and takes `displayWidth(label) + 2` cells, so
 * it costs the row nothing a padded word did not already cost.
 *
 * A meter belongs where a bounded value VARIES and where a reader is comparing
 * magnitudes rather than reading names. In this file there is exactly one such
 * place and it is not here — it is the loading dialog, where `done/total` is real
 * progress over countable work.
 *
 * THE PROVIDER COLUMN IS FIRST, AND IT IS A NAME. It used to be last-but-three and
 * printed the routing shortcut (`or@`, `oai@`, `cx@`); the owner's question on a
 * live run was *"what is 'or' means"*. A shortcut only reads as information to
 * someone who already knows it, so it teaches nothing about a screen whose whole
 * job is to say what is on offer. The column now prints the provider's readable
 * display name, sourced from the provider definitions through
 * `PickerProviderChoice.label` — never a name table here — and it leads the row,
 * because "which provider" is the question the user asked first. The shortcut is
 * not lost: it sits beside the full name in the `p` dialog, and inside the exact
 * `provider@model` spec on the detail line.
 *
 * A FILL IS FOR THE NOTABLE STATE, NOT FOR EVERY ROW — THE RULE THAT SHIPPED
 * BACKWARDS ONCE. A previous pass chipped the routing prefix and the billing mode on
 * EVERY provider row. Both columns then had a fill on all 17 rows, and with no blank
 * row between them the fills fused: the prefix column read as one solid grey vertical
 * band and the billing column as one solid green one, with the labels floating inside
 * them. That is the failure `widgets.tsx` already measured for 24 `UP` chips, and
 * correct padding does not prevent it — padding is not what makes the fills identical.
 * `ScopeTabs.tsx` in claudeup states the surviving rule: the ACTIVE tab is a filled
 * block, the inactive one is plain muted text with no background at all.
 *
 *   `or@` / `zengo@`  subtle TEXT             a routing IDENTIFIER, never a status
 *   `$`               QUIET chip, near-bg     metered — the unremarkable default
 *   `FREE` / `SUB`    SIGNAL chip, green      no per-token charge — the SAME claim
 *   `local`           SIGNAL chip, green      no charge either, by another mechanism
 *   `catalog`         warn text               NOT the live roster — `DiscoveryNotice`
 *   `N/A`             dead text               the catalog does not say
 *   selection         accent + `C.bgHighlight`, and a `▶` so it survives greyscale
 *
 * THE PREFIX KEEPS NO FILL AND `$` GOT ONE BACK — and the two are not the same
 * question. A routing prefix is an IDENTIFIER: every row has one, they have no
 * states, and a column with no notable member has nothing for a fill to mark. The
 * billing cell is a STATUS with a closed vocabulary, and the owner's instruction
 * after reading the shipped screen was *"make $$$ the same width and badge as
 * well"*: `SUB` filled beside a bare `$` left the column ragged, one chip floating
 * over a word with a different left edge. So the cell is now ALWAYS a chip, in one
 * of two fills.
 *
 * WHICH MEANS THE BANDING RISK IS REAL AND IS ANSWERED BY THE PAIR, NOT BY A GAP.
 * `$` and `SUB`/`local` partition the roster, so this is a fill on all 17 rows —
 * exactly the shape that fused into one grey band when the PREFIX was chipped. What
 * failed there was that all 17 fills were the SAME colour; here they alternate, and
 * the two fills are held apart by measurement rather than by hope: ΔE76 22.7 on the
 * light palette (`#BCE5CD` vs `#E2E6F0`) and 54.6 on the dark one (`#2f8250` vs
 * `#2E323D`), where ~2.3 is a just-noticeable difference. Pinned by
 * `theme-contrast.test.ts` so a future tweak that collapses them fails a test rather
 * than a screenshot. Verified on `dialog7-*` at 80x24 and 145x45, dark and light.
 *
 * THE LIGHT PAIR IS THE TIGHT ONE, AND DELIBERATELY SO. Both light chips are TINTS
 * (see `theme.ts`), so they sit within 0.1 of each other in luminance and the whole
 * distinction is HUE — 22.7 ΔE, ten just-noticeable differences, but a tenth of the
 * headroom the dark pair has. That is why the banding gate matters MORE under this
 * construction than under the saturated one it replaces, not less.
 *
 * AND THE QUIET HALF IS QUIET BY MEASUREMENT TOO. ΔE alone would accept two equally
 * loud fills of different hue, which is what shipped: a mid-grey `#6b7280` slab at
 * 4.53:1 on a light page beside a green at 4.70:1 — the same weight, so the column
 * read as two competing claims. The gate now also pins that `$` carries less than
 * half the CHROMA of `SUB` in whichever palette is loaded — the axis that survives
 * both constructions, since on a light page the two tints barely differ in weight.
 *
 * ONE FILL WIDTH FOR THE WHOLE COLUMN, WHICH IS THE ONE PLACE PADDING GOES INSIDE A
 * FILL. `aesthetics-and-color.md` forbids padding inside the label because 24 `UP`
 * chips in a ROW fused into a rectangle; that rule is about a row of identical
 * chips, and this is a single column whose whole point is a straight left and right
 * edge. So `CHIP_FILL_CELLS` is derived from the LONGEST label the column can ever
 * print (`local`, 5, + 2) and every chip paints exactly that, label centred inside —
 * a hardcoded 5 would have clipped `local` and `FREE` by the two cells Yoga then
 * steals from a neighbouring cell. Both columns that print these tokens use the same
 * number, so `$`, `SUB`, `FREE` and `local` line up in the provider list and in the
 * model list alike.
 *
 * `SUB` WAS `tokens.warn` UNTIL THIS PASS, AND THAT WAS A ONE-COLOUR-ONE-MEANING
 * VIOLATION IN THE SHIPPED BUILD, not in a prototype. `warn` is `C.orange` —
 * `#ff8800` on dark and a rust `#c2410c` on light — which is the hue this app
 * spends on failure. `SUB` is the opposite of a failure: it is the route the user
 * already pays for, free at the point of use. Red now means only failure here: the
 * `HTTP 4xx` badge and the discovery-failure panel, and nothing else.
 *
 * THREE CHIPS THAT LOOK THE SAME MEAN THE SAME THING. `FREE`, `SUB` and `local` share
 * one positive fill on purpose — all three say "running this costs you no per-token
 * money" — and the LABEL says by which mechanism. Splitting the hue would put three
 * meanings on one claim, which is rule 1 read backwards.
 *
 * A CHIP MARKS A TOKEN THAT VARIES DOWN ITS COLUMN. The price column varies in the
 * cross-provider list and inside a METERED provider (numerals, with the odd
 * `FREE`); inside a flat-rate or local provider every row carries the same word,
 * and identical fills stacked with no gap between rows is the failure the skill
 * MEASURED — 24 `UP` chips fusing into one solid rectangle with the labels floating
 * in it. There the word is drawn as coloured text instead. `chip` is that one
 * decision, taken by the caller that knows the scope.
 *
 * In particular the price NUMERAL is never colour-coded: a value takes discrete
 * buckets or nothing at all, and three buckets of dollars would put a third
 * meaning on `success` in a column already carrying `FREE`.
 *
 * ONE `<text>` PER ROW, ALWAYS. Yoga claws columns back from the LAST `<text>`
 * child of a row, which is how a branch name once rendered as `mai` with thirty
 * free columns beside it (`resume-picker.tsx:473-484`). So every cell is a
 * `<span>` inside a single text node.
 *
 * COLOUR IS READ AT RENDER TIME, never captured in a module-level `const`:
 * `C`/`tokens` are reassigned in place when the terminal theme is detected, and a
 * snapshot taken at import would ship the dark palette to a light terminal. That
 * bug has been found six times in this repo, once visible only in a live
 * screenshot.
