/**
 * Tier 2 — `testRender` over the real component tree, with the loaders injected.
 *
 * `renderOnce()` IS MANDATORY before every capture, or every cell comes back as
 * unpainted filler and the assertion measures nothing.
 *
 * TWO CAPTURES, TWO BLINDNESSES. `captureCharFrame()` sees text and layout and is
 * BLIND to a wash of coloured spaces and to a one-column stub of background left
 * behind by a squeezed widget — a whole character-level suite once passed over a
 * mangled row. `captureSpans()` sees colour, which is where the severity tiers and
 * the selection wash live. Both are used here, for the things each can decide.
 *
 * THE ASSERTIONS THAT MATTER MOST ARE THE ONES ABOUT THE REJECTED BUILD. The owner's
 * report was "super unclear what is happening"; the diagnosis was two panes each
 * holding a cursor, and a meter on every row carrying a value that was identical on
 * 19 of 32 rows. So: exactly ONE cursor glyph on screen, and NO block-fill glyph in
 * any list row. Both are decidable from a frame, and both would have failed the
 * build that shipped.
 *
 * AND THE ONES ABOUT THE ROUND-TWO CORRECTION, which are about what the picker does
 * NOT do. `calls` counts every loader the fake is asked for, so "nothing is fetched
 * before the user asks for it" is an assertion rather than a claim in a comment —
 * and it is the one that would have caught the build the owner rejected, which
 * looked correct and simply did too much.
 *
 * THE DATA SOURCE IS A PARAMETER, NEVER `mock.module()`: mocking shared
 * infrastructure bleeds across Bun's module registry and breaks sibling e2e files.
