/**
 * The ladder as it is actually reached: through `ComposedHandler.handle()`,
 * over a real socket, against a real refused port.
 *
 * Two validation criteria live here and both are demonstrated rather than
 * asserted in the abstract:
 *
 *   C-9  — a client disconnect stops the loop and releases the request within
 *          a second. Reachable because `Request.signal` was measured firing in
 *          0.49–0.86 ms in the HELD shape (handler awaiting, no headers sent).
 *   C-11 — `--probe` and the config TUI's Test All still fail fast. Without the
 *          `x-claudish-no-recovery` guard this feature breaks both tools for
 *          exactly the fault they exist to diagnose, and misreports it as
 *          `timeout` rather than `network error`.
 *
 * C-11 runs through a REAL `Bun.serve` and the REAL `probeLink`, not a
 * simulation of either: the header has to survive an actual HTTP hop for the
 * criterion to mean anything.
