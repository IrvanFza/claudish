/**
 * Claude SSE → a single Claude Messages JSON response.
 *
 * Every stream parser in this directory emits Claude SSE, because that is what
 * Claude Code wants for an interactive turn. But the Messages API also has a
 * non-streaming mode — `stream` absent or false — and Claude Code uses it for
 * one-shot internal calls, `/compact` being the one people notice.
 *
 * `NativeHandler` has always served those correctly by accident of its design:
 * it forwards the client's payload verbatim to Anthropic and branches on the
 * RESPONSE content-type, so a `stream: false` request comes back as JSON. Every
 * adapter's `buildPayload`, by contrast, hardcodes `stream: true` and
 * ComposedHandler answered with an event stream regardless. That is the whole
 * asymmetry: `/compact` worked on a native `claude-*` model and returned
 * unparseable `event: message_start` on every proxied one.
 *
 * Rather than give each of the six parsers a second output mode, this consumes
 * the SSE they already produce and folds it back into the object the
 * non-streaming API would have returned. One implementation, all stream formats,
 * and every behaviour that lives in the parsers (tool repair, thinking filter,
 * token accounting) applies unchanged.
 *
 * Deliberately tolerant: a malformed data line is skipped rather than thrown on,
 * and a stream that ends early still yields whatever content did arrive. A
 * partial answer beats a 500 for a client that cannot retry.
 */

import { log } from "../../logger.js";

/**
 * Give up after this long with NOTHING on the wire — not one byte, not a ping.
 *
 * Streaming mode never needed this: the client holds an open socket, sees the
 * turn stop producing, and the user cancels. Buffering removes that escape
 * hatch, because we `await` the stream to completion before anything reaches
 * the client, so a parser that never closes its controller hangs the caller
 * forever with no output to hint at why.
 *
 * The number is safe rather than tuned, because every parser in this directory
 * emits a keepalive `ping` on a 1-second interval for as long as it is alive
 * (openai-sse:215, anthropic-sse:210, gemini-sse:93, ollama-jsonl:62,
 * openai-responses-sse:206). A model that thinks for ten minutes still pings
 * ten minutes' worth, so this can never truncate a live turn — 120 seconds of
 * total silence means 120 consecutive missed pings, which only happens once the
 * parser is genuinely dead.
 *
 * It does NOT cover an upstream provider that goes quiet with the socket open:
 * the parser is alive there and keeps pinging on its behalf. That case is
 * unbounded in streaming mode today too, so buffering does not make it worse,
 * and fixing it belongs upstream where the provider socket actually lives.
