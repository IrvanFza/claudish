/**
 * Detecting "this provider does not carry that model" from an error response.
 *
 * ## Why this needs its own module
 *
 * Providers do not agree on how to report an unknown model, and some report it
 * under a status reserved for something else entirely. OpenCode Zen Go answers
 * **HTTP 401** with `"Model deepseek-v4-pro-0813 is not supported"` — a status
 * that otherwise means "your credential is bad". Measured 2026-08-18 against a
 * real `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY`: `zgo@deepseek-v4-pro-0813` returns 401 while
 * `zgo@kimi-k3` on the SAME key returns 200. The credential is provably fine and
 * the status is provably misleading.
 *
 * That matters because Zen Go sits early in a bare-name chain
 * (`deepseek-*` → opencode-zen-go → deepseek → openrouter). The chain still
 * advances — `isRetryableError` treats 401 as retryable, and OpenRouter probes
 * `live` — so no service is lost. What IS lost is the diagnosis: the probe
 * reported `auth-failed`, sending the user to check credentials that are
 * working, and burying the fact that a live hop exists further down.
 *
 * Two places must tell these apart, and they must not drift:
 *
 * 1. `composed-handler.ts` picks the user-facing hint. It already had this test
 *    inline and got it right — "Model not supported by this provider."
 * 2. `probe-live.ts` classifies the probe STATE, and did not — it returned
 *    `auth-failed` on the status alone, before any body inspection.
 *
 * One predicate, so the explanation and the state cannot disagree about what
 * happened. Same reasoning as `quota-exhaustion.ts`, which exists because a
 * spent plan also arrives under an auth-shaped status.
 *
 * Deliberately import-free: `probe-live.ts` has no dependencies at all, and a
 * pure string test keeps it that way with no risk of an import cycle.
 */

/**
 * Phrases that name the MODEL as the problem rather than the credential.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow, and the narrowness is load-bearing in the dangerous
 * direction: a false positive here tells a user with genuinely broken
 * credentials to go and check their model name instead. So every phrase names a
 * model or says "not supported" — never bare "invalid", "denied" or
 * "unauthorized", which are the vocabulary of real auth failures.

/**
 * Whether the provider already told the caller what to DO — i.e. its message
 * carries a link to act on.
 *
 * A generic recovery hint is a guess. When the provider has supplied an
 * actionable instruction, that guess stops being merely unhelpful and starts
 * CONTRADICTING the truth sitting next to it. Measured 2026-08-19, Zen Go
 * answers a model its account has not opted into with:
 *
 *   403 {"error":{"type":"RegionError","message":"The latest version of this
 *        model is only available hosted in China and requires explicit opt in:
 *        https://opencode.ai/workspace/<id>/go"}}
 *
 * The route is fine, the credential is fine, the model IS carried (it is in the
 * live roster, so the availability filter correctly kept the provider) — the
 * account simply has not opted into that region. claudish rendered it as
 * "Check API key / OAuth credentials.", sending the user to audit a working key
 * while the fix — a link — sat in the same sentence.
 *
 * Detecting the LINK rather than the wording is deliberate. "RegionError" is one
 * vendor's type name for one policy; the next provider will invent a different
 * one, and a phrase list would have to grow forever to keep up. A URL means the
 * same thing everywhere: there is a specific place to go, and claudish should
 * step out of the way rather than talk over it.
