/**
 * The block writer's own contract: an index is spent ONCE.
 *
 * Anthropic's wire identifies a content block by its index for the whole
 * message. Re-opening an index that already had its `content_block_stop` gives
 * the client two different blocks wearing one name — two `content_block_start`
 * frames, two full lifecycles — and makes the tool-observation hook in
 * `openai-sse.ts` count one call twice, against its own comment ("exactly one
 * `content_block_start` is emitted per tool call").
 *
 * THE PRODUCTION CALLER that reaches it: when a tool's argument fragments lose
 * the open block mid-stream (OpenAI's wire lets `tool_calls[0]` and
 * `tool_calls[1]` interleave; Anthropic's does not), `openai-sse.ts` degrades
 * that tool to the buffered path — `started = false; ref = null` — while KEEPING
 * its already-spent `blockIndex`. Finalization then asks for that index again.
 * The sequence below is that exact call order, taken from the two sites rather
 * than imagined.
 *
 * ## Provenance of the inputs
 *
 * These are calls on this tree's own function, not a provider's bytes. No `.sse`
 * fixture was invented to reach the degrade path: no capture in
 * `test-fixtures/sse-responses/` interleaves two unbuffered tool calls, and
 * writing one that did would be inventing the capture. The capture-driven gate
 * is `block-nesting.test.ts`, whose `nestingViolations` already reports
 * `index=N started twice` — so the day a real capture with interleaved calls
 * lands, it is covered there for free.
 *
 * §A.3: the writer must NEVER throw. Every case below asserts it corrected the
 * state and carried on.
