/**
 * The native-passthrough answer that `route()` cannot give, and the proxy's
 * pre-route decision that produces it.
 *
 * A bare Claude name (`claude-opus-5`, `opus`, `internal`) is served by the
 * proxy's native branch on the harness's own Claude Code auth. `native-anthropic`
 * has no credential store — on purpose, it is not a remote provider — so
 * `route()`'s credential filter drops it and the chain degrades to OpenRouter.
 * The proxy avoids that by asking {@link proxyRouteDecision} BEFORE it ever
 * routes (proxy-server.ts step 2c). Every other caller that consults `route()`
 * for a bare name must ask the same question first, or it reports a
 * subscription model as "no route" / "OpenRouter, metered" — which is what the
 * MCP `preflight` tool and the TUI route probe did.
 *
 * Explicit specs are never native: `anthropic@claude-opus-5` names a vendor,
 * and `dv@claude-opus-5-high` is Devin re-serving a Claude id under its own
 * prefix. `parseModelSpec` already resolves that precedence; this only reads it.
