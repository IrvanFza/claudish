/**
 * Every way claudish could call one model, gathered from the catalog and ordered.
 *
 * The step of the bare-name path (`explainBareName`) that runs when no USER rule
 * matches: `explainCatalogChain` (also behind `buildCatalogChain`) calls
 * {@link gatherRouteCandidates}. It replaced a hand-written table that named
 * providers per model family and had to be edited whenever a vendor, a plan or
 * a gateway changed.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOT. It does not decide whether a candidate can be USED.
 * Two filters already own that question and neither is duplicated here:
 *
 *   - the CREDENTIAL filter (`hasCredentialsForProvider` → the credential
 *     authority) — no key, no candidate;
 *   - the AVAILABILITY filter (`providerServesModel`, `model-availability.ts`) —
 *     the account's own dynamic models catalog may DENY, and absence of evidence
 *     never denies.
 *
 * So a candidate returned from here is a claim about what the CATALOG publishes,
 * not a claim that this user can call it. Re-asking either question here would
 * create a second oracle, and the pair would disagree the first time one changed.
 *
 * ── Why the catalog can be the only source ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Measured on generation `g-20260921062451697-f490edba` (1,123 entries):
 *
 *   - `aggregators[]` carries SUBSCRIPTION routes alongside gateways and native
 *     APIs — `moonshotai/kimi-code-subscription`, `openai/codex-subscription`,
 *     `z-ai/glm-coding-subscription`, `qwen/qwencloud-token-plan`,
 *     `opencode/go-subscription`. One source therefore covers every tier, and the
 *     tier is the only thing that has to come from claudish's own table.
 *   - The VENDOR needs no local table either: a connection whose
 *     `route.routeId` equals the entry's `provider` IS the vendor's own route.
 *     412 of 1,123 models have one; the remaining 709 are served only by
 *     gateways, which is a fact about those models rather than a gap. 100 entries
 *     carry vendor `unknown` and simply get no vendor preference.
 *   - 25 of the 28 published route pairs map to a claudish provider. The three
 *     that do not are `qwen/realtime-websocket` (a WebSocket API with no chat
 *     transport here), `openrouter/decisions` (output modality `["decisions"]`,
 *     not chat) and `opencode/systemone` (a profile claudish has never seen).
 *     Each is SKIPPED and counted in {@link CandidateGathering.unmappedRoutes} —
 *     never guessed at, because a guessed route binding sends a request to the
 *     wrong transport and reads as the model's failure.
 *   - Of 1,734 mapped connections, 923 carry a usable price and 811 do not.
 *     Unknown is a large minority, so the comparator must order it rather than
 *     treat it as an edge case: it sorts LAST among its tier.
 *
 * ── The order ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Decided by the project owner; {@link compareRouteCandidates} implements exactly
 * this and nothing else:
 *
 *     user rules (elsewhere, verbatim, never merged with any of this)
 *       then band:  subscription (both subscription tiers) → native → gateway → fallback
 *       within a band:  the model's own vendor first
 *                  then tier: subscription before dynamic-subscription
 *                  then cheapest by catalog price (unknown last)
 *                  then larger context window
 *                  then provider name, ascending, for determinism
 *
 * The two subscription tiers share one band so that a vendor's OWN dynamic
 * subscription goes first: `grok-4.x` goes Grok Build → OpenCode Zen Go → xAI.
 * With tier first, Zen Go's catalog-published plan led Grok Build, xAI's own,
 * on 3 of 1,143 catalog models (generation g-20260923145315478-d7a326bd); the
 * project owner decided the vendor's own plan leads (2026-09-24).
 *
 * No local preference list, and NO LOCAL STATE. A spent subscription limit is
 * never remembered: the request moves to the next hop, which is the existing
 * chain's job. A module that remembered would answer differently on two
 * identical inputs, and the reason would live nowhere a user could see.

/**
 * Candidates from a provider's NAMESPACE CLAIM — dynamic subscriptions only.

 * `client_model_selection_required`. The catalog cannot say what a seat was
 * given, so without this source a user's flat-rate plan would be invisible to
 * every gathered chain and the request would land on a metered hop — the one
 * ordering error that costs money rather than a better option.
 *
 * A claim is NOT evidence of service, and that asymmetry is the whole design:
 * the candidate exists so the AVAILABILITY filter can ask the account's own
 * dynamic models catalog, which is the only thing that can answer. Extending
 * this to any other tier would invent routes — a gateway's `nativeModelPatterns`
 * would claim every model in a namespace it may not carry, and nothing
 * downstream would contradict it, because a gateway answers a model it does not
 * have with a 4xx that reads as a credential problem.
 *
 * All four dynamic subscriptions now declare one: `devin` (`/^swe-/i`),
 * `antigravity` (`/^gemini-/i`), `grok-subscription` (`/^grok-/i`) and
 * `sakana-subscription` (`/^fugu/i`). The last three were added when the
 * hand-written table was deleted — without them the 15 models measured on
 * generation `g-20260921062451697-f490edba` as CLAIM-GAP would have moved off a
 * flat-rate plan onto a metered hop.
 *
 * A SECOND CLAIMANT ON A NAMESPACE IS FINE HERE, and that is a change from the
 * rule the old note stated. `getProviderForModel` — the function that picked one
 * winner per pattern — no longer exists. The two surviving consumers of
 * `nativeModelPatterns` both tolerate the overlap:
 *
 *   - `getNativeModelPatterns()` → `parseModelSpec` is FIRST-WINS on
 *     `BUILTIN_PROVIDERS` order, and each new claimant is defined BELOW the
 *     metered sibling that already owned the pattern (`google` < `antigravity`,
 *     `x-ai` < `grok-subscription`, `sakana` < `sakana-subscription`), so bare-name
 *     auto-detection is byte-identical to before;
 *   - this function, which iterates ALL providers and pushes every match — it
 *     wants the overlap, because that is how a flat-rate plan and the metered
 *     vendor both reach the ordering in {@link compareRouteCandidates}, where the
 *     tier puts the subscription first.
