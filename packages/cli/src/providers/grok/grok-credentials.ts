/**
 * Grok Build subscription credential — the Grok CLI's own OIDC token.
 *
 * `grok login` writes `~/.grok/auth.json` (mode 0600), keyed by an OIDC SCOPE
 * string rather than a fixed name:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "https://auth.x.ai::<client_id>": {
 *     "key": "<JWT>", "refresh_token": "...", "expires_at": "...",
 *     "auth_mode": "oidc", "oidc_issuer": "https://auth.x.ai",
 *     "oidc_client_id": "<client_id>"
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Two facts separate this from the Devin credential, which is otherwise the
 * closest analogue:
 *
 * 1. **The token expires in 6 hours** (measured: create 22:50:04Z → expires
 *    04:50:04Z). A claudish session routinely outlives that, so read-only access
 *    is not enough — this module refreshes.
 * 2. **Refresh needs no client secret.** `auth.x.ai`'s discovery document lists
 *    `"none"` in `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported`, i.e. a PUBLIC client,
 *    and the `client_id` is a field in the credential file itself. That makes
 *    this strictly simpler than Antigravity, which extracts a client_id/secret
 *    pair out of the user's local `agy` binary at runtime.
 *
 * The file is SHARED with a tool claudish does not own. An OIDC server may
 * rotate the refresh token on use, so a refresh that is not persisted would
 * leave the user's own `grok` CLI holding a dead token — claudish would have
 * broken someone else's tool. Write-back is therefore atomic (temp + rename,
 * mode preserved) and non-negotiable.
 *
 * Reads are deliberately NOT memoized. The file is ~1.7 KB, which is nothing
 * beside the HTTP request it authorizes, and the `grok` CLI may rewrite it
 * concurrently — a fresh read is how we notice.
 *
 * Full reverse-engineering write-up: `ai-docs/reports/grok-subscription/protocol-spec.md`.
