/**
 * Black-box tests: the Grok OAuth token refresh must not hang on a half-open token host.
 *
 * Spec (from the caller's brief): claudish refreshes an expired Grok OAuth token by POSTing
 * to `<issuer>/oauth2/token` behind a single-flight latch. The refresh must give up after
 * TOKEN_REFRESH_TIMEOUT_MS (20000 ms), fail as a CONNECTION error that names the token host,
 * release the latch, and still share ONE in-flight refresh between concurrent callers.
 *
 * Coverage map (requirement -> test):
 *   REQ-0  the ceiling is 20000 ms                       -> "REQ-0 ..."
 *   REQ-T1 hung host -> rejects within ~ceiling (< 30 s)  -> "REQ-T1 ..."
 *   REQ-T2 the rejection classifies as "unreachable"      -> "REQ-T2 ..."
 *   REQ-T3 the rejection carries claudishEndpoint         -> "REQ-T3 ..."
 *   REQ-T4 the latch clears: 2 sequential calls = 2 POSTs -> "REQ-T4 ..."
 *   REQ-T5 2 concurrent calls = exactly 1 POST            -> "REQ-T5 ..."
 *
 * The hung host is a real `Bun.serve` on an ephemeral port, so the real client and its real
 * timeout are exercised: no fetch double, no module mock. The timeout is really waited out,
 * so to keep the file near 60 s the waits are SHARED, never shortened:
 *   - T1, T2, T3 and T4 assert on ONE timed-out refresh (`firstTimedOutRefresh`). Whichever of
 *     them runs first starts it; the rest reuse its recorded outcome. Each test awaits it
 *     itself, so any one of them run alone (`-t`) still performs the call, and a refresh that
 *     never settles fails every one of them with "Received: pending" rather than passing.
 *   - T4 adds exactly one more call on the same host, so its host sees 2 POSTs in total.
 *   - T5 uses its own host and its own concurrent pair, so its request count is its own.
