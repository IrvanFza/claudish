/**
 * The one place endpoints get registered, and the one place that decides when.
 *
 * Six call sites need the provider roster to already contain the bundled
 * catalog — the interactive picker, `--probe`, the proxy, the parent-side
 * spawn pre-hydration, the config TUI and `serve` — and each of them reaches it
 * by a different path. A latch here means the answer does not depend on which
 * one ran first, and the config is read exactly once per process.
 *
 * ── Why this function is SYNCHRONOUS, and why that is the design ────────────
 *
 * Because nothing on this path can `await`, nothing on it can reach the
 * 1Password SDK — the SDK sits behind `await` inside the authority's async
 * `resolveKey`. THAT is the guarantee, and it is worth being exact about:
 * `op-source.ts` and `@1password/sdk` ARE in this module's static import
 * closure (via `predefined-endpoints` → `custom-endpoints-loader` →
 * `authority` → `api-key-credential`), so the protection is sync-ness, not
 * import-graph isolation, and a future edit could reach the SDK without
 * changing a single signature. It matters on a machine where concurrent
 * 1Password handshakes are arbitrated globally and a burst of denials trips a
 * 15-second machine-wide suppression. Registration reads `process.env`, the
 * config file and an array embedded in the binary. It opens no socket and
 * builds no handler: `buildProviderProfile` returns a closure, so nothing is
 * constructed until a request actually routes to one of these providers.
 *
 * Keep it sync. An `async` here would compile fine and quietly re-open that
 * door.
 *
 * ── Why there is an explicit re-evaluation entry point ─────────────────────
 *
 * The latch on its own breaks the config TUI's hydrate-on-add: importing a
 * 1Password key there hydrates `process.env`, drops handler caches and calls
 * `refreshConfig()` so providers light up WITHOUT a restart. A latched
 * registration would never re-ask, so a just-imported `GROQ_API_KEY` would
 * leave its vendor invisible until relaunch — reintroducing exactly the
 * before/after-hydration window that path exists to close. Hence
 * `{ force: true }` / `invalidateEndpointRegistration()`.
 *
 * Re-evaluation only ADDS: the runtime registry has no removal, so a row that
 * has since been disabled stays registered for the life of the process. That is
 * the right trade — the alternative is a de-registration path whose only
 * consumer is a config edit made mid-session, and a PARTIAL removal (definition
 * gone, credential registration and any cached handler still live) is worse
 * than a stale provider because it half-exists. The cost is paid in a warning
 * instead: `loadPredefinedEndpoints` names any row that was registered earlier
 * in this process and is no longer eligible, and says a restart is required.
 * Silence there was the actual defect — "I turned it off and it kept
 * answering" reads as a bug, not as a documented limit.
 *
 * ── SCOPE: both halves, and why they had to converge ───────────────────────
 *
 * This used to register the BUNDLED catalog only, with user-authored
 * `customEndpoints` loaded separately from `proxy-server.ts` and
 * `prehydrate.ts`. Both of those run AFTER the two surfaces that enumerate
 * providers — `--probe` (which `process.exit(0)`s in the `--probe` branch) and
 * the interactive picker — so a user who configured a custom endpoint could
 * not see it in the picker and could not probe it, even though it served real
 * requests correctly (#192).
 *
 * Folding them together also closes #191, because the reserved-namespace
 * refusal the catalog has always applied now covers user entries too.
 *
 * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING: the bundled catalog registers FIRST, user endpoints
 * second. `loadPredefinedEndpoints` suppresses any bundled row whose name a
 * user entry also claims (R4, "the user's entry replaces the bundled one"), and
 * it decides that from `config.customEndpoints` rather than from write order.
 * Registering users first would instead trip its `runtime.has(name) &&
 * !ownRegistrations.has(name)` branch and print an "already registered" warning
 * for a row that is being correctly replaced.
 *
 * CONFIG SCOPE: `customEndpoints` is read from the GLOBAL config only, and that
 * is deliberate rather than an oversight. `loadConfig()` and `loadLocalConfig()`
 * are separate reads with no merge, and the catalog's suppression set must be
 * built from the SAME object the loader reads — otherwise a project-scoped
 * `customEndpoints.groq` suppresses the bundled row while its replacement,
 * read from global config, never registers, and the provider disappears
 * outright. A project `.claudish.json` that declares `customEndpoints` is
 * therefore ignored, and `warnOnProjectScopedEndpoints` says so out loud
 * instead of leaving the user to discover it.
