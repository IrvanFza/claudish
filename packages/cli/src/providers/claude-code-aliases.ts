/**
 * Claude Code's TIER ALIASES — names that route to native Claude Code but are
 * not model ids the Anthropic API will accept.
 *
 * ## Why this distinction has to exist
 *
 * `parseModelSpec` sends every unrecognised bare name to `native-anthropic`
 * ("No '/' - treat as native Anthropic model"), so two very different things
 * arrive at that route:
 *
 *   - `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `internal`, `default` — Claude Code's own tier
 *     selectors. The API rejects them ("not a valid model ID"), but the ROUTE is
 *     healthy, so probing them verbatim would report a failure that does not
 *     exist. These need a concrete id substituted.
 *   - `swe-1.7`, `some-typo-model` — names nothing serves. At runtime
 *     `native-handler.ts` forwards `payload.model` VERBATIM and Anthropic answers
 *     404, so substituting a working id here makes `--probe` report `live` for a
 *     model that cannot serve a single request.
 *
 * The probe used to substitute for BOTH, which is how `swe-1.7` came to "probe
 * byte-identically to a nonsense string": the substitution erased the difference
 * between them before the request was ever sent.
 *
 * So the rule is: substitute for a KNOWN alias, pass everything else through and
 * let the API answer honestly.
 *
 * Kept import-free and separate from `team-orchestrator.ts`'s `SENTINEL_MODELS`
 * on purpose. That set answers a different question — "may this be spawned as a
 * claudish child process?" — and happens to list the same names today. Sharing
 * one set would couple two unrelated decisions; what matters is that neither
 * silently grows a name the other should have known about.

 * Normalize a `--model` value so a native-Anthropic SELECTOR becomes a name

 * `internal` and `default` are selectors, not model ids. Claude Code rejects
 * them outright — measured 2026-08-22, `claudish --model internal --stdin`
 * exits 1 with `[claude-code:unrecognized_model] {"model":"internal"}` and
 * "There's an issue with the selected model (internal)". The TIER they select
 * IS recognised: the same command with `--model opus` exits 0. So the fix is to
 * hand Claude Code the tier and let IT resolve the tier to the current model —
 * no id is pinned here, which is what the no-hardcoded-model-data rule requires.
 * (`--model claude-opus-4-1` also exits 0, but only because Claude Code remaps
 * it: "automatically remapped to Opus 5". Pinning ids is how the probe's
 * hardcoded default rotted; the tier cannot rot.)
 *
 * Everything else passes through untouched — `claude-*` ids are already valid,
 * and an explicit `provider@model` spec is not in the alias table at all.
 *
 * Applied at the `--model` parse boundary, so EVERY consumer sees the
 * normalized value: the proxy's native branch, the env handed to Claude Code,
 * `team` children, and `create_session` children (both spawn `claudish
 * --model X`, and that child normalizes at its own boundary).
