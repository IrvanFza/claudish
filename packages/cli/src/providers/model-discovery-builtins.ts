 * replace this branch with a `registerModelDiscoveryFetcher(name, fn)` seam —
 * not worth it for one." Antigravity was the third.
 *
 * What the move buys is dependency DIRECTION. Previously the generic discovery
 * module had to know about Devin's protobuf rpcs, Antigravity's OAuth POST and
 * Ollama's daemon shape, so adding provider #4 meant editing a file that has
 * nothing to do with provider #4. Now it knows none of them: it loads this
 * bundle once, on the first format it cannot serve itself.
 *
 * This module is only ever imported dynamically, which is what keeps the
 * protobuf codec and the Antigravity OAuth path off the cold-start path — the
 * property the original dynamic `import()` calls existed to protect.
