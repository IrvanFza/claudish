/**
 * Route bindings between claudish's names and catalog v3 routes, split by job.
 *
 * Model membership and wire ids remain catalog data. These tables only say which
 * name stands for which `(routeId, routeProfileId)` pair, and there are two jobs:
 *
 *   - {@link CATALOG_ROUTE_BINDINGS}, the ROUTING table. Every key is a claudish
 *     provider, built-in or a bundled catalog row (`together`, `fireworks`), that
 *     owns one endpoint and one credential silo. The candidate gatherer reads it
 *     through {@link routingProvidersForRoute}, so every key here can become a
 *     route candidate.
 *   - {@link LOOKUP_ONLY_ROUTE_BINDINGS}, names that catalog READS ask about and
 *     that no claudish provider answers to. They are never route candidates.
 *
 * The split exists because the gatherer returns every name bound to a route. A
 * read-only name in the routing table was a candidate by accident of spelling:
 * a custom endpoint a user named `anthropic` would have been gathered for every
 * model Anthropic's native API serves. The reads still see both tables
 * ({@link catalogRouteForProvider}, {@link catalogReadProvidersForRoute}), so each
 * of them answers exactly as before the split.
