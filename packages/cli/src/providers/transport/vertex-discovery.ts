/**
 * Vertex AI probe-model discovery — the models THIS project can actually call.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The cloud models catalog marks `vertex/google-cloud`
 * `client_model_selection_required` (measured on generation
 * `g-20260921062451697-f490edba`), by agreement with the backend: what a Vertex
 * caller may invoke depends on the user's project, its enabled APIs, its
 * permissions and its region, so no hosted pick can be right for everyone. That
 * is correct, and it also meant Test All had nothing to try and reported "no
 * probe model: transport does not support discovery" for a working install.
 *
 * So the account decides, which is the whole point: nothing here is a model id.
 *
 * WHAT THE ENDPOINT IS, MEASURED 2026-09-22 against ADC on a real project
 *
 *   GET https://<host>/v1beta1/publishers/google/models
 *       Authorization: Bearer <ADC token>
 *       x-goog-user-project: <project>
 *
 * - `v1beta1` is the ONLY version that answers: `/v1/publishers/google/models`
 *   is 404, as is a project-scoped `/v1beta1/projects/<p>/locations/<l>/…`.
 * - `x-goog-user-project` is REQUIRED for a user ADC credential. Without it the
 *   API answers 403 `SERVICE_DISABLED`: "authenticating by using local
 *   Application Default Credentials. The aiplatform.googleapis.com API requires
 *   a quota project". A request against a project-scoped URL (every generate
 *   call) carries the project in the path instead, which is why the transport
 *   itself never needed the header.
 * - The list is genuinely PER LOCATION, which is why the location comes from
 *   `resolveVertexConfig`: the same credential saw 132 models in `us-central1`,
 *   27 on the `global` host and 13 in `europe-west4`.
 *
 * WHAT IT RETURNS, AND WHY MOST OF IT IS NOT A CHAT MODEL
 *
 * The response is the Model Garden, not a chat menu: `{ publisherModels: [{
 * name, versionId, launchStage?, openSourceCategory?, publisherModelTemplate?,
 * supportedActions? }] }`. Alongside Gemini it lists notebook samples, OSS
 * checkpoints you deploy to your own endpoint, request-access research models
 * and the legacy vision/language APIs. Every filter below reads a field the API
 * itself publishes — there is no name list here, and adding one would be the
 * pinned-id failure this module exists to avoid.
 *
 * AND THE LISTING OVER-REPORTS, WHICH IS WHY THERE IS A SECOND STEP
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-22 on `us-central1`: the listing offers `gemini-3.8-flash`,
 * `gemini-3.7-flash`, `gemini-3.6-flash`, `gemini-3.5-flash` and every other
 * 3.x row, and ALL of them answer `404 NOT_FOUND "Publisher model … was not
 * found or your project does not have access to it"` when called there. The
 * same ids answer 200 on `global`. Only the 2.5 family is actually served in
 * `us-central1`. Nothing in the listing distinguishes the two: a per-model
 * `GET …/models/<id>?view=PUBLISHER_MODEL_VIEW_FULL` returns byte-identical
 * field sets for a servable and an unservable model, and no other endpoint
 * reports a per-region served set (`…/endpoints/openapi/models` is 404,
 * `…/locations/<l>/models` is the empty tuned-model registry).
 *
 * So the listing narrows the field and `:countTokens` decides it: measured on
 * the same account, countTokens answers 404 for exactly the models
 * generateContent 404s and 200 for the ones it serves. It bills nothing, it is
 * idempotent, and every candidate is checked in ONE parallel round (~1.6s for
 * five, bounded by the slowest call).
 *
 * The probe pick is therefore a model this PROJECT, in THIS location, answered
 * for — which is the only honest form the claim can take.
