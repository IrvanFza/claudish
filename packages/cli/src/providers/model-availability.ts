/**
 * "Does provider P actually serve model M?" — answered from BOTH data sources.
 *
 * ## Why two sources, and which one wins
 *
 * `catalog-client.ts` states the split this module depends on:
 *
 *   - The cloud catalog owns model IDENTITY — what a model is, what each vendor
 *     calls it. Same for everyone.
 *   - A provider's own live endpoint owns ENTITLEMENT — which subset of those
 *     models THIS key may use. Per-user, and impossible to hold statically.
 *
 * Neither is sufficient alone. Measured 2026-08-18: the catalog's `aggregators[]`
 * vocabulary names 18 providers while claudish routes to 23, and the 10 it never
 * mentions are almost entirely the SUBSCRIPTION providers — `glm-coding`,
 * `minimax-coding`, `qwen-token-plan`, `sakana-subscription`, `devin`,
 * `opencode-zen-go`. That is not a catalog defect: a plan's contents are an
 * entitlement, so they were never in scope for a field describing marketplaces.
 *
 * Live discovery covers exactly that gap, and it is AUTHORITATIVE where it
 * answers — it is the provider replying about the caller's own key.
 *
 * ## Why the result is three-valued
 *
 * `unknown` is not indecision, it is the answer that prevents a catastrophe. If
 * absence of evidence were read as "not served", every provider neither source
 * covers would be dropped from every chain — which for a while would have meant
 * dropping the user's paid subscription in favour of a metered hop. So a
 * candidate is removed only on POSITIVE evidence of exclusion; silence leaves it
 * exactly where it was.
 *
 * ## The case this exists for
 *
 * `deepseek-v4-pro-0813` on a bare chain reaches `opencode-zen-go` first. Zen Go
 * does not carry it and says so with **HTTP 401** — a status that reads as a
 * credential failure, and which masked the live OpenRouter hop further down the
 * same chain. Its dynamic models catalog answers the question before any request is sent:
 *
 *     Zen Go serves 26 models; 'deepseek-v4-pro-0813' is not among them
 *     (it serves the undated `deepseek-v4-pro`), while 'kimi-k3' is.
 *
 * Note the naming detail — the dynamic models catalog also settles what to SEND, which a
 * membership test against catalog ids alone could not.

 * The id this provider would ACTUALLY SEND for `wireId`, found by the same

 *
 * A provider that encodes knobs into its model ids never lists the bare
 * canonical id. Devin's dynamic models catalog holds `swe-1-7`,
 * `swe-1-7-medium` and `swe-1-7-lightning`, never `swe-1.7`, and its transport
 * maps the requested name onto one of them through `expandSelection` at request
 * time. This check used to compare the raw requested string instead, so it
 * answered "not-served" for every canonical id Devin carries, and "not-served"
 * is the one verdict allowed to REMOVE a candidate. Measured 2026-09-23 on a
 * 247-uid Devin catalog: `swe-1.7`, `swe-2`, `swe-1.6`, `glm-5.3` and
 * `kimi-k3` all read as not served, while the resolver maps them to
 * `swe-1-7-medium`, `swe-2-high`, `swe-1-6`, `glm-5-3-max` and `kimi-k3-high`.
 * A bare `swe-1.7` therefore lost its Devin hop and went to the OpenRouter
 * fallback, which answered "swe-1.7 is not a valid model ID", while the explicit
 * pin `devin@swe-1.7` worked.
 *
 * No effort is passed, so the resolver picks the family default. That is enough
 * to answer "is anything in this family served"; the transport resolves again
 * with the request's real effort when it sends. For a provider with no
 * resolver, `expandSelection` returns `wireId` unchanged, so their answer is
 * exactly what it was.
