/**
 * One comparable price per CONNECTION, read from the cloud models catalog.
 *
 * A connection is one mapped way to call a model — an `aggregators[]` entry
 * with `routeStatus: "mapped"`. Each carries the serving gateway's OWN rate, so
 * two connections to the same canonical model id routinely cost different
 * amounts. To order them, routing needs one number per connection, and this
 * module is the only place that decides what that number is.
 *
 * **What the number is for.** It exists to ORDER connections BEFORE a request
 * is built, when the input size is not yet known. That constrains it hard:
 *
 *   - Tiered prices are read from the FIRST tier and nothing else. The number
 *     never averages tiers, and it never selects a tier from a request's size —
 *     there is no request yet. A per-request cost estimate is a different
 *     calculation that would take the real input size as an argument; this is
 *     not it, and it must not be mistaken for it.
 *   - It is a rate in dollars per million tokens, summed over input and output
 *     (`input + output`), which is a ranking key rather than a bill. It assumes
 *     nothing about the input:output mix of the eventual request.
 *
 * **What an unknown price means.** claudish reads the discriminator
 * `pricing.type` and only `pricing.type` — there is no alias and no fallback
 * to any other field name. Unknown therefore means one of two concrete things:
 * the catalog published `type: "unavailable"` for that connection (467 of them
 * on generation `g-20260921062451697-f490edba`), or the connection carries no
 * pricing object at all. Unknown is a sizeable minority of any real list, so
 * every caller must render and sort it, never assume it away.
 *
 * Absent-means-unknown is a rule, never an inference: without the
 * discriminator this module does not know how to read the rest of the object,
 * so it does not treat the presence of `input`/`output` as evidence of a flat
 * price. Numbers read under a guessed type are worse than no numbers.

 * No branch here is speculative: on generation `g-20260921062451697-f490edba`
 * the catalog publishes `flat` for 975 connections, `unavailable` for 467,
 * `free` for 30 and `tiered` for 28.
 *
 * A `"tiered"` connection with no usable `tiers[0]` falls back to the
 * top-level `input`/`output`, which the catalog guarantees equal the first
 * tier, and keeps the `(first tier)` label because that is still what the
 * number is. A `"flat"` or `"tiered"` connection whose numbers survive neither
 * route is unknown — a declared type is not itself a price.
