/**
 * Grok OAuth — claudish's OWN login, no Grok CLI required.
 *
 * This is the deliberate opposite of the Antigravity arrangement, and the
 * difference is structural rather than a matter of taste:
 *
 *   Antigravity — Google registered its client as CONFIDENTIAL. The
 *   `GOCSPX-…` secret rotates, cannot be shipped in an npm package, and is
 *   therefore extracted from the user's own local `agy` binary at runtime.
 *   Owning that flow would mean chasing a secret that changes under us.
 *
 *   Grok — xAI registered the Grok CLI as a PUBLIC client. `auth.x.ai`'s
 *   discovery document lists `"none"` in
 *   `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported`, which is the correct registration
 *   for a CLI precisely because a widely-distributed secret is not a secret.
 *   There is nothing to rotate, so there is nothing to chase.
 *
 * So claudish drives the RFC 8628 Device Authorization Grant itself:
 * `POST /oauth2/device/code` → show the user a code + URL → poll
 * `POST /oauth2/token` until they approve. Device flow rather than
 * authorization-code + loopback because claudish frequently runs where a
 * localhost redirect cannot be received — an MCP child, a `team` fan-out, a
 * remote shell — and the device flow is the one grant that works in all of them.
 *
 * The result: `claudish login grok` works on a machine that has never had the
 * Grok CLI installed. Reading the CLI's own `~/.grok/auth.json` remains
 * supported as a FALLBACK (see `grok-credentials.ts`), so an existing
 * `grok login` is still picked up for free.

 * Taken from the `scope` claim of a working `grok login` token rather than
 * guessed from the issuer's `scopes_supported`, and that distinction cost a
 * round trip: an earlier version requested a sensible-looking subset
 * (`openid profile email offline_access grok-cli:access`) and login SUCCEEDED —
 * the IdP happily issued a token — but every inference request then failed
 *
 *   403 {"code":"permission-denied",
 *        "error":"OAuth2 token missing required scope: api:access"}
 *
 * So the authorization server and the resource server disagree about what a
 * usable token looks like, and only the resource server's opinion matters. A
 * scope set that logs in cleanly is NOT evidence of a working credential.
 *
 * `offline_access` is separately load-bearing: without it the IdP issues no
 * refresh token, and a 6-hour access token with no refresh means
 * re-authenticating three times a day.
 *
 * Note `team:read`, `org:read` and `grok-plugins:access` are advertised by the

 * matching the CLI is the known-good configuration, and asking for authority we
