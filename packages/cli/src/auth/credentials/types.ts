/**
 * Credential Authority — core interfaces.
 *
 * A {@link CredentialProvider} is the single authority for one catalog provider's
 * credentials. The surface is fully ASYNC — readiness and request-auth both pull
 * from 1Password on demand when env/config/oauth-file miss. There is NO sync
 * readiness oracle anymore: 1Password resolution is async, so a credential
 * decision is async too. Resolution is memoized per provider, so the first
 * await pays the SDK cost and subsequent reads are free.
 *
 *  - `isAvailable()` — ASYNC readiness: env var set? config key? oauth file on
 *    disk? local provider enabled? op:// resolvable? Never throws (a 1Password
 *    auth failure resolves to `false`, it does not bring down the caller).
 *  - `getRequestAuth()` — ASYNC, produces the rich artifact (headers, optional
 *    endpoint override, optional payload transform) for an outgoing request.
 *    OAuth token refreshes and op:// pulls happen here, internally.
 *  - `invalidate()` — drop any memoized resolution (after a TUI hydrate-on-add).
 */

/**
 * Three-valued credential readiness — "I could not ask" is NOT "there is
 * nothing there".
 *
 * `isAvailable()` answers a boolean, and a boolean has exactly one slot for two
 * different facts. Every resolution failure therefore collapsed into `false`,
 * which reads downstream as "this user has no credential for this provider":
 * the candidate is filtered out of the routing chain and a metered provider
 * serves the request with no line printed. A locked Mac, a denied 1Password
 * handshake or a keychain ACL the user declined would silently move a
 * flat-rate subscriber onto pay-per-token.
 *
 *  - `present` — a credential resolved (or none is required).
 *  - `absent`  — every source was consulted and none holds one. A STABLE answer.
 *  - `failed`  — a source could not be consulted at all. TRANSIENT, and it says
 *                nothing about whether the credential exists.
 *
 * `failed` still keeps a candidate out of the chain — a credential that will
 * not resolve cannot sign a request either — so routing is unchanged. What is
 * new is that the REASON survives to the caller. The same line the keychain
 * engine draws (`{present, failed}` / `{value?, failed}`) and the same line the
 * op source draws for denied handshakes, carried one layer further up.
