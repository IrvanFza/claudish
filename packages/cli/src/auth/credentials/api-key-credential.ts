/**
 * ApiKeyCredentialProvider — the credential authority for API-key providers.
 *
 * Resolution order (ASYNC, memoized per provider):
 *   1. process.env[envVar]
 *   2. process.env[alias] for each alias
 *   3. getApiKey(envVar) — config.json apiKeys map
 *   4. macOS Keychain (lazy `security`, only when 1-3 missed AND the backend is on)
 *   5. 1Password (op:// — lazy SDK, only when 1-4 missed AND an op source exists)
 *
 * Keychain precedes 1Password because it is local, prompt-free once its ACL is
 * established, and ~17ms — where a 1Password resolve is a desktop-app handshake
 * that can be denied, and whose denials trip a 15-second machine-wide
 * suppression. Both remain BELOW env and config: a user who exports a key, or
 * types one into the config, means it.
 *
 * When step 4 or 5 resolves a key, the value is written THROUGH into process.env
 * so spawned child processes (MCP team/channel) inherit it and never touch the
 * SDK or the keychain. The authority is the ONLY code that pushes keys from
 * either vault into process.env.
 *
 * `describeReadiness()` reports `present` / `absent` / `failed`, and
 * `isAvailable()` is its `=== "present"` projection. Steps 4 and 5 are the two
 * measured ways a REAL credential resolves to nothing — a locked or declined
 * keychain, a denied 1Password handshake — and both used to arrive here as a
 * bare `""`, indistinguishable from "this user has no key". That is what let a
 * flat-rate subscription be dropped from the routing chain and replaced by a
 * metered provider with nothing printed. The reason now survives; what routing
 * DOES with it is unchanged, since `failed` still projects to unavailable.
 *
 * `describeReadiness()` additionally honors one affordance the legacy oracle
 * granted:
 *   - `oauthFallback`: a `<file>` under ~/.claudish/ — if that OAuth credential
 *     file exists, the provider is available even without an env/config/op key.
 *
 * There used to be a second, `publicKeyFallback`, which made a provider report
 * available on the strength of a hardcoded literal token. It is gone: a keyless
 * provider declares `authScheme: "none"` instead, which is handled below and
 * says no credential is expected rather than inventing one.
 *
 * Resolution is memoized: the first await pays the env/config/op cost; later
 * reads return the cached result. `invalidate()` clears it (TUI hydrate-on-add).
 * An empty/failed op resolve is NOT cached as "" — it's cached as "unavailable"
 * only after the op source is consulted, and `invalidate()` re-opens it.
