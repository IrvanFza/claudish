/**
 * Grok Build subscription credential — the Grok CLI's own OIDC token.
 *
 * The `grok-subscription` provider definition sets `apiKeyEnvVar: ""`, and that
 * is load-bearing rather than an oversight. proxy-server's generic
 * credential-extraction block runs only for a NON-empty value and derives the
 * key by stripping `Bearer ` from `auth.headers.Authorization`. That would
 * "work" here by accident — the artifact really is a bearer token — but it would
 * hand proxy-server a token that expires in six hours and cache it past its
 * life, bypassing the refresh this provider exists to perform. Keeping the env
 * var empty makes proxy-server skip the block and forces every request through
 * `getRequestAuth()`, which is the only place expiry is checked. Same structural
 * choice as Devin and Antigravity, for a different underlying reason.
 *
 * `XAI_API_KEY` is deliberately NOT aliased here. That key is the METERED `x-ai`
 * credential; honouring it would let a pay-per-token key authenticate a provider
 * claudish reports as flat-rate `SUB` — the exact ambiguity that keeps
 * `openai-codex` out of `SUBSCRIPTION_PROVIDERS`.
