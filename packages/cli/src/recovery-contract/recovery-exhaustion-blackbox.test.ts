/**
 * CONTRACT POINT 4 — at exhaustion the client gets 503 when a recovery banner
 * is confirmed on screen, and 400 when it is not.
 *
 * ONLY THE NEGATIVE ARM IS HERE, and that is a finding rather than an omission:
 * "a banner is confirmed on screen" has no published way to be SET from outside
 * the proxy independently of the switch that also enables the ladder, so the
 * 503 arm and the 400 arm cannot both be produced in one experiment (trap
 * T-13). See test-results.md — it needs a documented pane-attach seam or a PTY
 * end-to-end run.
 *
 * Every status below is read from `Response.status` of a fetch against the
 * proxy's own URL. This project's documented failure mode is that a terminal
 * error is remapped to 400 on the way out, so a status asserted anywhere
 * upstream of the socket is measuring a different thing than the user gets
 * (trap T-6).
