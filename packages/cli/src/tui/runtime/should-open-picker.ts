/**
 * should-open-picker.ts — the model picker's launch gate, as one pure predicate.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. Until now nothing asked whether a terminal was there.
 * `index.ts` opened the picker on `cliConfig.interactive` alone, and `cli.ts`
 * sets that flag true whenever there is no positional prompt, no `--stdin` and
 * no `-p`:
 *
 *     if (!config._hasPositionalPrompt && !config.stdin && !config._hasPrintFlag)
 *       config.interactive = true;
 *
 * So `claudish < /dev/null`, `claudish` on a CI runner, and `claudish` detached
 * all reached a prompt that drew into a stream nobody reads and then blocked on a
 * keypress that could never arrive. `-p` was already excluded — `_hasPrintFlag`
 * exists precisely to stop that default flipping on — and
 * `ai-docs/architecture/headless-vs-interactive.md` is why that matters: `-p
 * --input-format stream-json` is the mode where a wrong flag yields silence and
 * exit 0, so the picker must never appear in it. This predicate makes the piped
 * and detached cases fail the same way, by asking the one question that was
 * missing.
 *
 * WHY NOT A FALLBACK TO THE LINE-ORIENTED PROMPT. Inquirer in a non-TTY is the
 * bug, not the safety net: it draws into an unread stream and waits for a key
 * that cannot come. "Falling back" would be falling back to a hang. So
 * `requiresExplicitModel` routes the same cases to the existing non-interactive
 * error — four actionable lines naming `--model`, `CLAUDISH_MODEL`, `--profile`
 * and `claudish --models` — and exit 1.
 *
 * THE TTY ANSWER IS A PARAMETER, NOT AN IMPORT. Both functions here are total
 * over their inputs and read nothing from the process, which is what makes the
 * whole 2^5 grid table-testable without running `runCli`. `index.ts` supplies the
 * answer from `canDrawTui()`, the single isTTY oracle next door. For the same
 * reason as that file: THIS MODULE IMPORTS NOTHING, and keeps `index.ts`'s cold
 * static graph clean.
