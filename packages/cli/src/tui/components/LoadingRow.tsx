/**
 * LoadingRow — one row that says what is loading and how much is known about it.
 *
 * ONE `<text>`, always: bar · figure · label. Sibling `<text>`s in a row are the
 * arrangement Yoga shrinks from the last child inward, so every part of the row
 * is a `<span>` inside a single text node (`viz/widgets.tsx` documents the
 * measured failure; `resume-picker.tsx:473-484` is where this repo hit it).
 *
 * THE ROW'S SHAPE IS THE HONESTY CONTRACT, and it is chosen by what the caller
 * can actually measure:
 *
 * | Caller knows | Pass | Draws |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | work done / work total | `pct` 0–100 | a determinate `MeterSpan` |
 * | nothing but that it started | `pct` omitted | a travelling `ShimmerSpan` |
 * | the value is absent, not zero | `pct: NaN` | `MeterSpan`'s dim `╌` run |
 *
 * The third row is not a curiosity: `Meter` paints a full-width TRACK for `NaN`
 * unless it is guarded, which is pixel-identical to a healthy 0% — a dead sensor
 * that looks idle. `MeterSpan` already draws `╌` instead, and passing `NaN`
 * through rather than coercing it is what keeps that distinction alive here.
 *
 * A DEADLINE IS NOT PROGRESS. `pct = 100 * elapsed / deadline` renders fine and
 * says something true only if the LABEL says which it is (`… · 2.1s / 5.0s
 * deadline`). Where no deadline is published, omit `pct` and put the elapsed
 * figure in `value` — an elapsed counter with no bar makes exactly one claim.
 *
 * `value` is right-aligned in a reserved column so a counter ticking from `9/31`
 * to `10/31` cannot shove the label sideways every frame.

 * bar is the best possible outcome, so `load` would paint a finished credential
 * sweep in alarm red and make red mean "error" on one row and "done" on the next.
 * `volume` is the repo's one-hue, no-valence ramp — length carries the
 * comparison, brightness carries the magnitude, and neither makes a health claim.
 * Pass `ramps.savings` if a full bar should read as an achievement rather than as
