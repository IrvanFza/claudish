/**
 * viz/tokens.ts — the semantic palette. Hex is the public dialect.
 *
 * Vendored from the `bunjs:opentui-tui` skill's `assets/theme/tokens.ts`, with TWO
 * deliberate deviations from the shipped file. Everything else — the token NAMES, the
 * `Ramp` type and its non-empty bound, the ramp STRUCTURE (an explicit midtone stop so
 * `blendStops` never desaturates through the middle) — is unchanged. `color.ts` and
 * `text.ts` beside it are byte-identical copies; `widgets.tsx` carries three ADDITIVE
 * changes, each documented at its own definition and none altering shipped behaviour:
 * `Panel`'s `flush` prop, and the `<span>` twins `MeterSpan` / `SparklineSpan` (with
 * `sparkGlyphs` extracted so the twin cannot drift from `Sparkline`). The twins exist for
 * the reason the file already gives for `BadgeSpan` — a `<text>` cannot nest in a `<text>`,
 * so every ONE-`<text>` widget is un-composable in a mixed row, and the alternative, flex
 * `<text>` siblings, is the arrangement Yoga silently shrinks. Never scatter hex
 * literals in components: import a token. If a value you need is missing, add a token
 * HERE first — a one-off literal in a component is how a palette stops being a palette.
 *
 * DEVIATION 1 — THE HEXES ARE CLAUDISH'S, NOT THE SKILL'S DEFAULTS.
 * The skill ships a Catppuccin-ish palette; claudish already has one — the btop-inspired
 * neon-on-true-black `C` in `../theme.ts`, which the config TUI, the probe TUI and the
 * static probe results printer all render from. Two palettes in one process would break
 * the skill's own rule 1 ("a colour means ONE thing app-wide") and rule 5 ("one border
 * style, one accent"), and would make the new session surfaces look like a different
 * program from `claudish --probe`. So this file is an ADAPTER: it keeps the skill's
 * semantic tier and re-points every value at `C`, which stays the single source of truth.
 * No hex is written down here that is not already in `C`.
 *
 * DEVIATION 2 — `chromeIntent` IS GONE, because it cannot compile on our pin.
 * It called `RGBA.defaultForeground` / `RGBA.defaultBackground`; MEASURED against the
 * installed `@opentui/core@0.1.87`, `lib/RGBA.d.ts` declares only `fromArray`,
 * `fromValues`, `fromInts` and `fromHex`, so both are `undefined` and the module threw
 * `TypeError: RGBA.defaultForeground is not a function` at import time — which took down
 * every test in `widgets.test.tsx` before one of them ran. It is the skill's own
 * "optional second tier", nothing in `color.ts` or `widgets.tsx` imports it, and claudish
 * pins 0.1.x on purpose (`build:binary` ships a `bun build --compile` binary, and the
 * skill's version matrix puts `--compile` on 0.1.x). Dropping it is the version
 * adaptation, not a downgrade — restore it if claudish ever moves to 0.4.x.
 */
import { C } from "../theme.js"

/**
 * Severity / status, then chrome. A token means ONE thing across the whole app:
 * red is error everywhere, or glanceability dies.
 *
 * Several pairs deliberately share a hex because `C` has one value where the skill's
 * palette had two — `fatal`/`error` are both `C.red`, `debug`/`idle` are both
 * `C.fgMuted`, `trace`/`subtle`/`dead` are all `C.dim`. They keep separate names for the
 * same reason the skill kept `dead` and `subtle` apart: they mean different things and
 * may diverge.
 *
 * `bgPanel` IS `C.bgAlt` (#111111) AND NOT `C.bg` (#000000), which looks like a rounding
 * of the true-black aesthetic and is not. A panel background equal to the terminal void
 * is not a background: nothing distinguishes a row the panel painted from a row it never
 * reached. `widgets.test.tsx`'s `painted()` helper says so in its own comment —
 * "unpainted terminal comes back 0,0,0" — and with a black `bgPanel` it counted all 12
 * rows of a 3-row panel, failing three Panel tests whose LAYOUT an independent probe
 * showed to be correct. #111111 also matches what several existing claudish panels
 * already pass (`C.bgAlt` appears beside `C.bg` throughout `tui/components/`), and gives
 * the btop lift the skill's rule 6 asks for: dim chrome, quiet frame, saturated signal.

 * A gradient's STOPS — AT LEAST ONE, and that bound is load-bearing rather than

 * and rendered a ZERO-WIDTH meter — 40 columns asked for, none painted, nothing thrown.
 * A non-empty tuple makes that call a COMPILE error. A computed `string[]` no longer

 *
 * The explicit midtone is the point (`color.ts` documents why): a two-stop green→red
 * blend desaturates to a muddy olive through the middle, so every ramp names the colour
 * it should pass through. `C`'s neon stops are far more saturated than the skill's
 * defaults, so the measured midpoint floor goes UP, not down.
