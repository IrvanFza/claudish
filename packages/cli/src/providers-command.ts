/**
 * `claudish providers --json` — non-interactive credential-presence report.
 *
 * The claude-desktop-profiles app uses this to annotate the model catalog with
 * "configured on this machine" vs. not. It needs to know WHICH providers have
 * working credentials here and WHERE those credentials come from — but never
 * the credentials themselves.
 *
 * Output (one entry per non-virtual provider):
 *   { "providers": [
 *       { "slug": "x-ai",   "ready": true,  "authSource": "env" },
 *       { "slug": "google", "ready": false, "authSource": null }
 *   ] }
 *
 * The `slug` is the canonical BUILTIN_PROVIDERS name (catalogName) — the same
 * string `claudish serve` accepts as a pinned `provider` in its models.json,
 * and the string parseModelSpec/resolveRemoteProvider match on. (NOT the
 * TUI-facing alias: e.g. slug is "google", not the picker label "gemini".)
 *
 * SECURITY: this command emits credential PRESENCE and SOURCE only. It must
 * never touch the --probe provenance path (which prints unmasked keys) and
 * must never include any value, masked fragment, or key material whatsoever.

 * which structurally cannot see a 1Password-only key, so every op-sourced
 * provider was reported `ready: false` and the profiles app concluded the
 * machine had no credentials at all.
 *
 * `describeSource` resolves all providers concurrently; resolution is serialized
 * behind the op queue and a 1Password Environment is fetched once per process,
 * so this is ONE handshake for the whole list rather than one per provider.
