/**
 * Killing a spawned `claudish` means killing a TREE, not a process.
 *
 * The shape, on every spawn site in this repo:
 *
 *   orchestrator / session manager
 *    └─ node bin/claudish.cjs        ← the pid we hold
 *        └─ bun dist/index.js        ← the real CLI, owns the proxy
 *            └─ claude               ← Claude Code
 *                └─ bash, MCP servers, …
 *
 * `stdio: "inherit"` passes fd 0/1/2 all the way down, so the DEEPEST process
 * holds the write end of the pipe our caller reads. Signalling only the pid we
 * hold therefore kills the launcher and orphans everything that matters: it
 * keeps running, keeps billing, and keeps writing into our pipe.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-15 against this exact topology:
 *
 *   SIGTERM to pid    → launcher dies, child leaks 330 B AFTER the kill
 *   SIGKILL to pid    → identical — 330 B still leaks
 *   SIGTERM to GROUP  → clean, 0 B
 *
 * SIGKILL not helping is the tell: this was never a stubborn process ignoring
 * signals, it was signalling the wrong process. In a real `team` run it cost a
 * model that was declared TIMEOUT with 0 B and then wrote a complete 40,699 B
 * answer into the response file 375 s later, where the judging phase scored it
 * as an empty submission.
 *
 * bin/claudish.cjs now forwards catchable signals, which fixes the common case
 * on its own. The group kill is still required, because nothing running inside
 * the launcher can forward a SIGKILL aimed at the launcher.
