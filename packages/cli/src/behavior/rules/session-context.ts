/**
 * Keep Claude Code's own session context OUT of the model's answer.
 *
 * Background (measured, not assumed). A `SessionStart` hook's stdout is NOT
 * written to `claude -p`'s stdout — probed 2026-08-18 against CC 2.1.233 with a
 * hook emitting a sentinel and a one-word prompt: stdout came back as exactly
 * `"banana\n"`, sentinel absent from both stdout and stderr. So hook output
 * reaches the model the only other way it can: as injected context the model
 * READS.
 *
 * Which means a foreign model can decide it is content to reproduce. In team
 * session team-20260815-115227, `response-01.md` (minimax-m3) and
 * `response-04.md` (kimi-k3) both OPEN with the host session's SessionStart
 * output — a "Coaching" block recommending `npx claudeup`, and an "Insight"
 * block — instead of the requested deliverable. The blind judges penalised both
 * in those words: "leaked harness boilerplate in deliverable", "irrelevant
 * coaching preamble violates the requested structure". Two of six models, and
 * it moved their scores.
 *
 * ## Why this is a behaviour rule and not a hermeticity fix
 *
 * The obvious fix — don't give children the host's hooks — has no lever:
 *
 *   · Hooks MERGE across settings tiers. Probed 2026-08-18: a project-tier
 *     `SessionStart` hook still fired with `--settings '{"hooks":{}}'` layered
 *     above it, which is the highest (CLI-args) tier. A settings overlay cannot
 *     clear an inherited hook.
 *   · `--bare` does skip hooks, but also skips CLAUDE.md auto-discovery, plugin
 *     sync and auto-memory, and defers the MCP connection past `system/init`
 *     (see CLAUDE.md). Team children need their project context and MCP tools —
 *     the grok run in that very session made 6 `mcp__…__search_pattern` calls.
 *   · A clean `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` loses the user's MCP servers and plugins for
 *     the same reason.
 *
 * So the context is going to arrive. What claudish can change is what the model
 * DOES with it — which is exactly Layer 4's job.
 *
 * Following the layer's design rule ("put the fact where the decision is made"),
 * this states the convention in the system prompt, where the model decides how
 * to open its answer. It is deliberately NOT a post-hoc filter on the response:
 * there is no reliable way to tell "boilerplate the model echoed" from "the
 * user's own words quoted legitimately", and a wrong strip would delete real
 * content from a deliverable.
