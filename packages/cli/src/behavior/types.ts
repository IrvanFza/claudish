 * Layer 4: Behavior Compatibility Layer — core types.

 * This layer translates the thing none of those cover: the *behavioral
 * conventions* the agent harness expects. A foreign model can speak the OpenAI
 * wire format perfectly, use every tool correctly, and still break Claude Code
 * because it did not follow an unwritten protocol.
 *
 * The motivating case: CC 2.1.220's ExitPlanModeV2 takes no `plan` parameter —
 * it reads the plan from a file at a CC-assigned path. gpt-5.6-sol wrote a
 * complete plan to a filename it invented instead, so CC found nothing at the
 * assigned path, reported `plan: null`, and degraded the approval dialog to a
 * bare yes/no with no permission-elevation option.
 *
 * Rules never mutate the request themselves. They RETURN actions, and the engine
 * applies them. That keeps every change attributable to a rule id, loggable, and
 * testable without a live request.
