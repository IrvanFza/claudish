/**
 * Live divergence log.

 * The offline corpus builder (corpus.ts) mines RECORDED transcripts. This is its

 * real traffic to the same file, so both sources feed one dataset that new rules
 * can be written from.
 *
 * Every write is best-effort and fire-and-forget. A diagnostic log that can fail
 * a user's request would be worse than no log at all.
