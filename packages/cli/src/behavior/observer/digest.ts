/**
 * Observer input construction.
 *
 * The observer never sees the conversation. It sees a DIGEST: which tools are on
 * offer, what the harness looks like, and the shape of the call the model just
 * proposed. Two reasons, both load-bearing:
 *
 *  - Latency. The observer runs beside a live request. Feeding it 180K tokens of
 *    context would cost more than the request it is advising on.
 *  - Privacy. A digest carries no message text, so enabling a local advisory
 *    model never widens what the user's conversation is exposed to.
 *
 * Argument VALUES are omitted except for path-like fields, which are the subject
 * of the checks themselves and stay on the machine (the observer is a local
 * model). Everything else is reduced to key names.
