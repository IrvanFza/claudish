/**
 * Behaviour telemetry — per-session aggregation.
 *
 * The server contract accepts ONE aggregate per Claude Code session, not one
 * record per decision (`docs/specs/behavior-telemetry-backend.md`). So decisions
 * are counted in memory for the life of the process and emitted once.
 *
 * ## Why this spools to disk instead of uploading directly
 *
 * A session ends when claudish exits, and `process.on("exit")` handlers are
 * SYNCHRONOUS — a `fetch` started there never completes. Blocking shutdown on a
 * network round-trip is not an option either: claudish exits when Claude Code
 * does, and the user is waiting on their prompt.
 *
 * So exit does the one thing it can do reliably — an `appendFileSync` to an
 * outbox — and delivery happens on a later run, in the background, while a
 * process is alive to await it. This is the same trade `stats-buffer.ts` makes
 * for the same reason, and it means a hard kill loses nothing.
 *
 * ## Consent
 *
 * Everything here is a no-op unless `behavior.telemetry.enabled` is true. That
 * flag is deliberately separate from `stats.enabled` — see BehaviorConfig.

 * resolution across 200K-1M, which is exactly where 1M-context models live.

 * Kept anyway because session size is a real, separate question, and because
 * removing or re-cutting the boundaries would split stored data at the change,
 * while adding `context_fill_pct` alongside cannot. Any change to these values
