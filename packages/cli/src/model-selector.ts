 *    falling back to a hang: inquirer in a non-TTY draws into a stream nothing is
 *    reading and then waits for a keypress that cannot arrive. `index.ts` cannot reach
 *    this branch (its own gate closed it), but `profile-commands.ts:559` can, and
 *    `grep isTTY profile-commands.ts` returns nothing. So `claudish profile edit` under
 *    a pipe now fails fast with four actionable pointers instead of hanging forever.
 *
 * 2. **`CLAUDISH_PICKER=classic` → the inquirer implementation.** Rollback is an env
 *    var rather than a revert, which matters because this screen is on every user's
 *    startup path and NO test drives the flow being replaced. The removal trigger is
 *    recorded in `ROADMAP.md`.
 *
 * 3. **`--free` keeps its current behaviour — the throw.** `getFreeModels()` is a
 *    documented stub returning `[]`, so `--free` has been unreachable since the Zen
 *    removal. Routing it to the classic path preserves the exact exception rather than
 *    inventing a UI nobody specified for a flag nobody can use.
