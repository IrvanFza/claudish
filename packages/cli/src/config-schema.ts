/**
 * Config schemas for the LiteLLM-demotion refactor (Phase 1).
 *
 * Defines:
 *   - BuiltinDefaultProviderSchema — enum of provider names users can name as
 *     their default provider for bare model names.
 *   - CustomEndpointSimpleSchema    — "URL + format + key" custom endpoints.
 *   - CustomEndpointComplexSchema   — full provider profile (Phase 3 will register).
 *   - CustomEndpointSchema          — discriminated union of the two.
 *   - DefaultProviderSchema         — builtin enum OR custom-endpoint name string.
 *
 * NOTE: This module is intentionally NOT imported by `profile-config.ts`.
 * Validation happens at the consumption site (Phase 3 will add a
 * `loadCustomEndpoints()` helper that calls Zod and warns on invalid entries).
 * Keeping `profile-config.ts` Zod-free matters because `loadConfig` is called
 * from many lightweight code paths.

 * How a custom endpoint authenticates.

 * `"none"` exists because there was previously NO WAY to reach an endpoint that
 * wants no credential — a local gateway, an inference server on a trusted
 * network. `apiKey` was `z.string().min(1)`, so `""` failed validation, and any
 * placeholder ("none", "x") was sent as a real `Authorization: Bearer none`
 * header. Reported in #139 by a user whose local router rejected the stray
 * header; the whole entry was refused with `Too small: expected string to have
 * >=1 characters`, which reads as a bug in claudish rather than a missing
 * feature.
 *
 * It is EXPLICIT rather than inferred from an absent `apiKey`. A misspelled key
 * field ("apikey", "api_key") would otherwise silently downgrade an endpoint to
 * unauthenticated and send the user's prompts out with no credential — a failure
 * that looks like it worked. Requiring the declaration means the only way to get
 * no auth is to ask for it.
