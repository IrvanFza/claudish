/**
 * The picker's PUBLIC CONTRACT — what the two call sites are allowed to assume.
 *
 * FR-5 is that `selectModel(options)` still resolves to a model spec string and that
 * `index.ts` and `profile-commands.ts` keep working. The success path cannot be driven
 * from a unit test (it needs a terminal and a human), so this file pins the parts that
 * CAN be decided without one: the non-TTY refusal, the shape of the cancel error, and —
 * at the source level — that the two call sites still look the way the contract says
 * they do. The last of those is a grep, and a grep is the only mechanism that catches a
 * call site quietly changing shape while every type still checks.
