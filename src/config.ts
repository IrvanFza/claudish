    description: "Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking is a reasoning-first chat model in the Qwen3-Next line that outputs structured “thinking” traces by default. It’s designed for hard multi-step problems; math proofs, code synthesis/debugging, logic, and agentic planning, and reports strong results across knowledge, reasoning, coding, alignment, and multilingual evaluations. Compared with prior Qwen3 variants, it emphasizes stability under long chains of thought and efficient scaling during inference, and it is tuned to follow complex instructions while reducing repetitive or off-task behavior.\n\nThe model is suitable for agent frameworks and tool use (function calling), retrieval-heavy workflows, and standardized benchmarking where step-by-step solutions are required. It supports long, detailed completions and leverages throughput-oriented techniques (e.g., multi-token prediction) for faster generation. Note that it operates in thinking-only mode.",

Compared with prior Qwen3 instruct variants, it focuses on higher throughput and stability on ultra-long inputs and multi-turn dialogues, making it well-suited for RAG, tool use, and agentic workflows that require consistent final answers rather than visible chain-of-thought.\n\nThe model employs scaling-efficient training and decoding to improve parameter efficiency and inference speed, and has been validated on a broad set of public benchmarks where it reaches or approaches larger Qwen3 systems in several categories while outperforming earlier mid-sized baselines. It is best used as a general assistant, code helper, and long-context task solver in production settings where deterministic, instruction-following outputs are preferred.",

Unlike traditional TTS systems, it allows creators to shape the emotional tone, pacing, and soundscape of their audio through the use of inline audio tags. These tags are enclosed in square brackets and act as stage directions—guiding how a line is spoken or what sound effects are inserted—without being spoken aloud. This enables rich, expressive narration and dialogue for applications like audiobooks, games, podcasts, and interactive media. Whether you’re aiming for a tense whisper, a sarcastic remark, or a dramatic soundscape full of explosions and ambient effects, v3 gives you granular control directly in the text prompt. This bot will also run text-to-speech on PDF attachments / URL links.\n\nExamples of voice delivery tags include:\n* [whispers] I have to tell you a secret. \n* [angry] That was *never* the plan.\n* [sarcastic] Oh, sure. That’ll totally work.\n* and [laughs] You're hilarious.\n\nExamples of sound effect tags are:\n* [gunshot] Get down!\n* [applause] Thank you, everyone.\n* and [explosion] What was that?!\n\nThese can also be combined.\n\nMultiple speakers can be supported via the parameter control. Dialogue for multiple speakers must follow the format, e.g. for 3 speakers:\n\nSpeaker 1: [dialogue]\nSpeaker 2: [dialogue]\nSpeaker 3: [dialogue]\nSpeaker 1: [dialogue]\nSpeaker 2: [dialogue]\n--speaker_count 3 --voice_1 [voice_1] --voice_2 [voice_2] --voice_3 [voice_3]\n\nThe following voices are supported:\nAlexandra - Conversational & Real\nAmy - Young & Natural\nArabella - Mature Female Narrator\nAustin - Good Ol' Texas Boy\nBlondie - Warm & Conversational\nBradford - British Male Storyteller\nCallum - Gravelly Yet Unsettling\nCharlotte - Raspy & Sensual\nChris - Down-to-Earth\nCoco Li - Shanghainese Female\nGaming - Unreal Tonemanagement 2003\nHarry - Animated Warrior\nHayato - Soothing Zen Male\nHope - Upbeat & Clear\nJames - Husky & Engaging\nJames Gao - Calm Chinese Voice\nJane - Professional Audiobook Reader\nJessica - Playful American Female\nJuniper - Grounded Female Professional\nKaro Yang - Youthful Asian Male\nKuon - Acute Fantastic Female\nLaura - Quirky Female Voice\nLiam - Warm, Energetic Youth\nMonika Sogam - Indian-English Accent\nNichalia Schwartz - Engaging Female American\nPriyanka Sogam - Late-Night Radio\nReginald - Brooding, Intense Villain\nShanShan - Young, Energetic Female\nXiao Bai - Shrill & Annoying\n\nPrompt input cannot exceed 5,000 characters.",
